<p>We are investing over &pound;300m in 54 new, British built, state-of-the-art electric trains for London Overground. Delivery of these new electric trains has been delayed while the manufacturer, Bombardier Transportation, carries out further software development. The trains will be brought into use&nbsp;between Gospel Oak and Barking&nbsp;as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Four-car temporary service</h2>

<p>Until the new trains are ready for use, four-car electric trains&nbsp;are running&nbsp;approximately every 30 minutes on weekdays between Gospel Oak and Barking. There s a similar level of capacity on the line (compared to January), but trains&nbsp;do not run as frequently.</p>

<p>See station travel options (below) for the times of trains for most of the day. First trains and trains after 22:00 run at slightly different times. Supplementary buses are an alternative option, alongside local bus routes.</p>

<p>Our train and full supplementary bus timetables are&nbsp;<a href="/modes/london-overground/london-overground-timetables">available here</a>.</p>

<p>There may be further changes or closures at weekends.</p>
