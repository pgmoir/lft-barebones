<h2>How long have you been cycling in London?</h2>

<p>Since 1999 when I moved here for my first job straight out of uni. It took me 15 minutes to walk to work but I cut that to just 5 on the bike!</p>

<h2>What got you into cycling?</h2>

<p>I've cycled since the age of 4 and never looked back. Unlike a lot of people - particularly women - I've never given up, not even during the adolescent years. When I was a teenager my rides would involve just taking my rubbishy pink Raleigh 'racer' round the block a few times to blow away the cobwebs and get some exercise.</p>

<h2>Why do you ride a bike?</h2>

<p>It's simply the quickest, easiest, and most enjoyable way of getting around. Also during my job at Carry Me Bikes which means sometimes riding cargo bikes for work!</p>

<h2>Where do you cycle?</h2>

<p>Anywhere I need to go, up to a max of 40 minutes. Most of my journeys are local to East London, but I'm cycling into central London a couple of times a week at the moment too.</p>

<h2>What would you say to women considering cycling in London?</h2>

<p>Do it! Find a friend or two who already does it and ask their advice, both men and women. Take up the offer of <a href="/modes/cycling/cycling-in-london/cycle-skills">Cycle Skills</a> from your council with a 1-2-1 session because you will learn loads and gain a lot of confidence. Spend at least &pound;200 on a bike and don't be taken in by fancy gears. You only need about 3 gears for most of London unless you'll be carrying kids or heavy stuff frequently. Don't worry about getting sweaty. No-one else will notice. You think they will, but they won't. You will just look fresher and more awake!</p>

<h2>What do you like most about cycling in London?</h2>

<p>It's the best way to enjoy the city and feel connected to it. It also saves you so much money and makes sure you get some regular exercise in a city that's not particularly conducive to sport.</p>

<h2>How does cycling make you feel?</h2>

<p>Alive, awake, free, exhilarated, slightly out of breath.</p>

<h2>What bike do you ride?</h2>

<p>I ride many different bikes, but my main bike is a Bobbin Bramble with a big basket. It's a take on the 'sit-up-and-beg'-type bike that is surprisingly speedy.</p>

<h2>What helped you to cycle in London?</h2>

<p>Getting involved in my local group of the <a href="http://lcc.org.uk/">London Cycling Campaign.</a> I met loads of lovely people who were so helpful with tips about the physical aspect of cycling (better use of gears, better-fitting bike, better-quality bike) as well as showing me great local routes and short-cuts. I made friends then in the early 2000s that I still have today. And we're all still cycling!</p>

<h2>Do you often cycle with someone?</h2>

<p>I'm normally getting from place to place by myself. It's a useful bit of head space to be honest. Although the Family Bike Rides that we are running as part of our <a href="http://cyclinggrants.london/">Cycling Grants London</a> project mean some fantastic fun rides with local families including many tiny tots!</p>
