<h2>What got you into cycling?</h2>
<p>On the 29/1/2010 I had a serious accident and ended up in a wheelchair and house bound with lots of operations to follow and finally in March 2013 I had my right leg amputated  below knee this has still left me with complications.</p>
<p>Over the next few years I put weight on and no matter how hard  I tried  I couldn't lose the weight. I ended buying a fold up bike and giving it a go. I didn't have full bend on my knee at the time so it made cycling hard and my balance was all over the place (I kept falling off the bike). I never gave up. Last February I bought a road bike - by then my cycling had improved and I was able to bend my knee. In June I cycled coast to coast with <a href="http://limbpower.com/">Limbpower</a> and although I needed help, I managed to cycle 187 miles over 3 days.</p>
<h2>Who do you cycle with?</h2>
<p>I always cycled on my own as I thought I was too slow to cycle with a group, but last year I finally joined a <a href="https://www.letsride.co.uk/breeze">Breeze ride</a> cycling from Redbridge. Apart from hills which are incredibly hard for me as I'm using one leg, I had a super experience and ended up going out with the Breeze girls every week. In October I had another operation on my leg so I was unable to cycle for two months, this drove me mad as cycling is my freedom! In January I joined Redbridge cycling club, a very friendly club and everyone is so kind and caring.</p>
<h2>What would you say to women considering cycling?</h2>
<p>If I can cycle, you can. It's great fun. It might be challenging but you meet amazing friends. I don't feel alone any more and I have my freedom back. I feel fitter and healthier and its all down to getting on a bike.</p>
<h2>What types of rides do you take part in?</h2>
<p>On 17 April this year I completed the London Phoenix Easter classic 70 miles, I may not have been the fastest but I finished it, this is the longest ride I've done and I was super chuffed with myself, my friends were praising me so much.</p>
<p>The thing with being an amputee is everyone thinks once your leg has gone you're fine, but it's not like that. It comes with more problems than ever - I'm not pain free, my leg sweats when I cycle, I get sore skin, but the enjoyment is greater than what I can feel.</p>
