      <p>We need to clean up London's air and rid the Capital of the most polluting vehicles. The Mayor has an ambition to make London's transport network zero carbon by 2050 - this will bring improvements in air quality (see the <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/the-mayors-transport-strategy">Mayor's Transport Strategy</a>).</p>

<p>To achieve this we need to support and accelerate the shift to zero emission technologies.</p>
      
           
      
<div>




<h2>Electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure delivery plan</h2>

<p>Speeding up the switch to electric vehicles is critical to creating a zero emission future. The Mayor established the&nbsp;Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure Taskforce in 2018. Experts from the public and private sector representing business, energy, infrastructure, government and London boroughs - supported by more than 350 stakeholders from over 140 different organisations - looked at ways to unlock barriers to expanding charging infrastructure and accelerating the switch to EVs in London.</p>

<p>The London electric&nbsp;vehicle infrastructure delivery plan shows fleets, businesses and London's residents that there is a clear way forward towards the right type and amount of charging infrastructure to serve London's needs.</p>

<h2>Zero emission capable (ZEC) vehicles</h2>

<p>ZEC is the collective term for vehicles that can operate with zero exhaust emissions. Most car and van manufacturers have ZEC models available, with more due to come to market in the next few years. Find out more about ZEC vehicles, and get help to choose the right vehicle for you, at <a href="https://www.goultralow.com/">Go Ultra Low</a>.</p>

<p>There are three types of ZEC vehicles:</p>

<ul>
	<li>100% pure electric vehicles are powered by a battery which drives the electric motor. They have no exhaust emissions. Battery electric vehicles typically have a range of around 80 miles but some can achieve up to 300 miles</li>
	<li>Plug-in hybrid and range-extended electric vehicles also have a conventional diesel or petrol engine, meaning they have a longer range than with a battery alone</li>
	<li>Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles have a fuel cell which uses hydrogen to produce electricity and power the vehicle's wheels. They typically have a range of around 300 miles</li>
</ul>

<h3>Benefits</h3>

<p>By switching to a zero emission capable vehicle you can save money on fuel costs, reduce harmful vehicle emissions and help clean up London's air.</p>

<p>There are also financial benefits:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Zero emission-capable vehicles that meet the criteria are eligible for a <a href="/modes/driving/congestion-charge/discounts-and-exemptions">100% discount on the Congestion Charge</a></li>
	<li>The Government offers grants for new plug-in vehicles, currently up to &pound;3,500 for cars, &pound;1,500 for motorcycles, &pound;8,000 for vans and &pound;7,500 for taxis. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/plug-in-car-van-grants/what-youll-get">Find out about plug-in car grants</a></li>
	<li>Zero emission capable vehicles pay either no vehicle tax (VED) or a reduced rate depending on their CO2 emissions, vehicle list price and year of registration. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ultra-low-emission-vehicles-tax-implications">Find out about tax benefits</a></li>
	<li>There is a range of <a href="http://carfueldata.direct.gov.uk/">tax incentives for business users</a></li>
	<li>Some London boroughs offer free or reduced-charge parking for electric vehicles</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to charge your vehicle</h2>

<p>Most people charge at home overnight or at their workplace, but some will need to charge while they are on the move. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/government-grants-for-low-emission-vehicles">Grants are available for electric vehicle charging infrastructure</a> at home and at workplaces.</p>

<p>Public charge points can be found on the street and in key destinations such as shopping areas. You will usually need your own charging cable to use public charge points, although rapid charge points have the cable built in.</p>

<p>Different manufacturers use different connector types. Check with your vehicle manufacturer to find out what type of connector your vehicle uses and whether it is capable of rapid charging.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.zap-map.com/live/">Charge point maps by Zap-Map</a> show where your nearest public charge point is, the connector types, charging speeds, which network the charge point is operated by and how much it will cost to charge. Frequent users can join network membership schemes. Most networks also offer pay as you go charging.</p>

<p>We have guidance and research&nbsp;about zero emission capable vehicles that will help us, the London boroughs and charge point providers&nbsp;put charging infrastructure in the right places. <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/ultra-low-emission-vehicle-research">Find out about ULEV research.</a></p>

<h2>Rapid charge points for London</h2>

<p>Rapid charge points can charge an electric vehicle battery in 20-30 minutes. This is quicker than regular charge points that can take 7-8 hours for a full charge.</p>

<p>At most of these charge points you can pay as you go with a credit or debit card - you don't need to be a member.</p>

<p>Rapid charging bays (e-bays) are designed to be used by electric vehicle users only while charging. Any other vehicle parked in the bay may be issued with a penalty.</p>

<p>We've created more than 180 rapid charge points across London &#45; we're committed to installing 300 by 2020.</p>

<h3>Mayor's map of electric vehicle charge points</h3>

<p>The London Electric Vehicle Charge Points map is a simplified map of rapid charge points across Greater London and up to the M25. The map shows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Your nearest public and taxi-only charge points</li>
	<li>Charging speed</li>
	<li>Which network the charge point is operated by</li>
	<li>Operating hours</li>
	<li>Charge points delivered with our support</li>
</ul>

<p>The map does not currently show all non-TfL funded charging points across London.</p>

<h2>Taxi-only rapid charge points</h2>

<p>The Mayor wants to establish London's taxi fleet as the greenest in the world and to phase out diesel. New taxis need to be zero-emission capable to be licensed. Tighter requirements have also been introduced for private hire vehicles (minicabs). Find out more about our how we're creating <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/taxis-and-private-hire/emissions-standards-for-taxis">greener taxis</a> and <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/taxis-and-private-hire/emissions-standards-for-phvs">greener PHVs</a>.</p>

<p>Rapid charge points will promote the greening of London's iconic black cab fleet, with many charging points dedicated exclusively to their use. E-taxi bays in several places are being restricted to London licensed e-taxis only. Drivers of other electric vehicles who park in an e-taxi bay risk getting a penalty. <a href="https://www.zap-map.com/">Find alternative charging locations on the Zap-Map website.</a></p>

<h2>Rapid charging networks</h2>

<p>Five networks&nbsp;are responsible for installing, operating and maintaining rapid charge points on public land across London:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.esb-evsolutions.co.uk/">ESB EV Solutions</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://fastned.nl/en/locations">Fastned</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.chargepointservices.co.uk/drivers/">GeniePoint</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://polar-network.com/">POLAR</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.sourcelondon.net/">Source London</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Drivers will be able to pay to use rapid charge points without having to register or being a member of a scheme. Visit the network websites for more information on charging costs.</p>

<h2>Customer support</h2>

<p>Customers will be supported by network operators at 24-hour, seven-days-a-week call centres. They have access to the latest information, such as the location and availability of rapid charge points, both on the web and through apps. The location data is being made available to encourage developers to create more apps.</p>

<h2>Go Ultra Low City Scheme</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.londoncouncils.gov.uk/our-key-themes/transport/roads/gulcs">Go Ultra Low City Scheme (GULCS)</a> is a joint TfL, Greater London Authority and&nbsp;boroughs project that aims to deliver over 1,500 on-street electric charge points for London's residents and car club vehicles by the end of 2020. The residential charging network will help Londoners without access to off-street parking make the switch to zero emission capable vehicles. Car club charge points will help car club operators transition their fleets.</p>

<p>The GULCS project is also funding at least six 'Neighbourhood of the Future' (NoF) projects - these will act as a testbed for innovative EV charging technologies, initiatives and policies to support the growth of clean vehicles in London.</p>

<h2>Commercial vehicles</h2>

<p>Zero emission capable vehicles can help businesses and commercial drivers reduce costs, emissions and the level of servicing and maintenance required.</p>

<p><a href="http://locity.org.uk">LoCITY</a> is an industry-led programme to help the freight and fleet sector lead the way in improving air quality and reducing carbon emissions.</p>

<h2>Additional research</h2>

<p>In addition to London's electric vehicle delivery plan we have other research about zero emission capable vehicles that will help us, the London boroughs and charge point providers put charging infrastructure in the right places .</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/ultra-low-emission-vehicle-research">Ultra Low Emission Vehicle research page.</a></p>
