        <p>Zero emission capable (ZEC) vehicles have environmental and financial benefits, and will help London become a zero carbon city by 2050. We are working with partners to develop a network to help you charge them quickly and efficiently.</p>
        
      </div>
    
    <div class="on-this-page">
      <h2>Cleaner air and zero emission capable vehicles</h2>

<p>We need to clean up London's air and rid the Capital of the most polluting vehicles. The Mayor has an ambition to make London's transport network zero carbon by 2050 - this will bring improvements in air quality (see the <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/the-mayors-transport-strategy">Mayor's Transport Strategy</a>).</p>

<p>To achieve this we need to support and accelerate the shift to zero emission technologies.</p>

<p>Zero emission capable (ZEC) is the collective term for vehicles that can operate with zero exhaust emissions. Most car and van manufacturers have ZEC models available, with more due to come to market in the next few years. Find out more about ZEC vehicles, and get help to choose the right vehicle for you, at <a href="https://www.goultralow.com/">Go Ultra Low</a>.</p>

<h2>Vehicle types</h2>

<p>There are three types of ZEC vehicles:</p>

<ul>
	<li>100% pure electric vehicles are powered by a battery which drives the electric motor. They have no exhaust emissions. Battery electric vehicles typically have a range of around 80 miles but some can achieve up to 300 miles</li>
	<li>Plug-in hybrid and range-extended electric vehicles also have a conventional diesel or petrol engine, meaning they have a longer range than with a battery alone</li>
	<li>Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles have a fuel cell which uses hydrogen to produce electricity and power the vehicle's wheels. They typically have a range of around 300 miles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<p>By switching to a zero emission capable vehicle you can save money on fuel costs, reduce harmful vehicle emissions and help clean up London's air.</p>

<p>There are also financial benefits:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Zero emission-capable vehicles that meet the criteria are eligible for a <a href="/modes/driving/congestion-charge/discounts-and-exemptions">100% discount on the Congestion Charge</a></li>
	<li>The Government offers grants for new plug-in vehicles, currently up to &pound;3,500 for cars, &pound;1,500 for motorcycles, &pound;8,000 for vans and &pound;7,500 for taxis. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/plug-in-car-van-grants/what-youll-get">Find out about plug-in car grants</a>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Zero emission capable vehicles pay either no vehicle tax (VED) or a reduced rate depending on their CO2 emissions, vehicle list price and year of registration. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ultra-low-emission-vehicles-tax-implications">Find out about tax benefits</a></li>
	<li>There is a range of <a href="http://carfueldata.direct.gov.uk/">tax incentives for business users</a></li>
	<li>Some London boroughs offer free or reduced-charge parking for electric vehicles</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to charge your vehicle</h2>

<p>Most people charge at home overnight or at their workplace, but some will need to charge while they are on the move. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/government-grants-for-low-emission-vehicles">Grants are available for electric vehicle charging infrastructure</a> at home and at workplaces.</p>

<p>Public charge points can be found on the street and in key destinations such as shopping areas. You will usually need your own charging cable to use public charge points, although rapid charge points have the cable built in.</p>

<p>Different manufacturers use different connector types. Check with your vehicle manufacturer what type of connector your vehicle uses and whether it is capable of rapid charging.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.zap-map.com/live/">Charge point maps</a> show where your nearest public charge point is, the connector types, charging speeds, which network the charge point is operated by and how much it will cost to charge. Frequent users can join network membership schemes. Most networks also offer pay as you go charging.</p>

<p>We have guidance and research&nbsp;about zero emission capable vehicles that will help us, the London boroughs and charge point providers&nbsp;put charging infrastructure in the right places. <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/ultra-low-emission-vehicle-research">Find out about ULEV research.</a></p>

<h2>Rapid charge points for London</h2>

<p>Rapid charge points can charge an electric vehicle battery in 20-30 minutes. This is quicker than regular charge points that can take 7-8 hours for a full charge.</p>

<p>At most of these charge points you can pay as you go with a credit or debit card - you don't need to be a member.</p>

<p>There are currently more than 150 rapid charge points across London - we're committed to installing at least 300&nbsp;by 2020.</p>

<p>Rapid charging bays (e-bays) are designed to be used by electric vehicle users only while charging. Any other vehicle parked in the bay may be issued with a penalty.</p>

<p>We're investing &pound;18 million and working with the boroughs and other organisations to provide the rapid charging points the Capital needs. Sites will be on arterial roads, owned and maintained by TfL, borough roads, car parks and on private land, including Heathrow Airport and multiple Shell service stations.</p>

<h2>Taxi-only rapid charge points</h2>

<p>The Mayor wants to establish London's taxi fleet as the greenest in the world and to phase out diesel. New taxis need to be zero-emission capable to be licensed. Tighter requirements have also been introduced for private hire vehicles (minicabs). Find out more about our how we're creating <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/taxis-and-private-hire/emissions-standards-for-taxis">greener taxis</a> and <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/taxis-and-private-hire/emissions-standards-for-phvs">greener PHVs</a>.</p>

<p>Rapid charge points will promote the greening of London's iconic black cab fleet, with many charging points dedicated exclusively to their use. E-taxi bays in&nbsp;several places&nbsp;are being restricted to London licensed e-taxis only. Drivers of other electric vehicles who park in an e-taxi bay risk getting a penalty. <a href="https://www.zap-map.com/">Find alternative charging locations on the Zap Map website.</a></p>

<h2>Rapid charging networks</h2>

<p>Five networks will be responsible for installing, operating and maintaining rapid charge points on public land across London. These networks are <a href="http://www.esb-evsolutions.co.uk/">ESB EV Solutions</a>, <a href="https://fastned.nl/en/locations">Fastned</a>, <a href="https://www.chargepointservices.co.uk/drivers/">GeniePoint</a>, <a href="https://polar-network.com/">POLAR</a> and <a href="https://www.sourcelondon.net/">Source London</a>.</p>

<p>Drivers will be able to pay to use rapid charge points without having to register or being a member of a scheme. Visit the network websites for more information on charging costs.</p>

<h2>Customer support</h2>

<p>Customers will be supported by network operators&nbsp;at&nbsp;24-hour, seven-days-a-week call centres. They have access to&nbsp;the latest information, such as the location and availability of rapid charge points, both on the web and through apps. The location data is being made available to encourage developers to create more apps.</p>

<h2>Go Ultra Low City Scheme</h2>

<p>The Go Ultra Low City Scheme (GULCS) is a joint TfL and borough programme that aims to deliver over 1,000 on-street electric charge points for London's residents and car club vehicles by the end of 2020. The residential charging network will help Londoners without access to off-street parking make the switch to zero emission capable vehicles. Car club charging points will help car club operators transition their fleets. Contact your local borough's transport officer to register your interest in a charge point.</p>

<p>The GULCS project is also funding at least six 'Neighbourhood of the Future' (NoF) projects - these will&nbsp;act as a testbed for innovative EV charging technologies, initiatives and policies to support the growth of clean vehicles in London.</p>

<h2>Commercial vehicles</h2>

<p>Zero emission capable vehicles can help businesses and commercial drivers reduce costs, emissions and the level of servicing and maintenance required.</p>

<p><a href="http://locity.org.uk">LoCITY</a> is an industry-led programme&nbsp;with information to help the freight and fleet sector reduce emissions and switch to ZEC vehicles.</p>
