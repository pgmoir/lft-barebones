        Cycle Superhighway 9 (CS9) would transform roads in west Kensington, Hammersmith, Chiswick and Brentford town centre to make cycling and walking easier, safer, and more appealing.
        
      </div>
    
    
      <p>We consulted on our plans in autumn 2017. An updated consultation report and our response to the issues raised during is now available on the <a href="https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/roads/cs9/?cid=cs9">Cycle Superhighway 9 consultation page</a>.</p>

<p>We consulted on two parts of the route in winter 2019:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Kew Bridge and Kew Bridge Road to Wellesley Road</li>
	<li>Duke Road and Duke's Avenue's junction with Chiswick High Road</li>
</ul>

<p>Details are on the <a href="https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/roads/kew-duke/?cid=kew-duke">Kew Bridge/Duke Road consultation page</a>.</p>

<h2>Why we're proposing the project</h2>

<p>The new superhighway would provide a clearer and safer route for cyclists in west London, largely separating them from other vehicles.</p>

<p>The route, between Kensington Olympia and Brentford, connects town centres in west London through Hammersmith and Chiswick. It will link important amenities and facilities and make the areas more pleasant to live, work and spend time in.</p>

<p>The changes would also make it easier for pedestrians to cross busy roads and remove through-traffic on some residential roads.</p>

<h2>Cycle Superhighways</h2>

<p>The route would form part of London's expanding network of Cycle Superhighways.</p>

<p>These are an important part of the <a href="/corporate/about-tfl/the-mayors-transport-strategy">Mayor's Transport Strategy</a> and <a href="/corporate/about-tfl/how-we-work/planning-for-the-future/healthy-streets">Healthy Streets approach</a>, which aim to encourage walking, cycling and using public transport, and make London greener, healthier and more pleasant.</p>

<p>The proposed changes between Kensington Olympia and Brentford town centre include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A two-way segregated cycle track on Hammersmith Road, King Street and Chiswick High Road</li>
	<li>Five new signal-controlled pedestrian crossings and more than 20 upgraded pedestrian crossings</li>
	<li>Reducing through traffic and rat-running in residential roads by restricting access to the South Circular from Wellesley Road and Stile Hall Gardens for motor vehicles, making these streets more appealing places to walk and cycle</li>
	<li>Stepped cycle tracks (at a lower height than the footway) in each direction on Brentford High Street; eastbound stepped track on Kew Bridge Road, westbound cycle path through Waterman's Park</li>
	<li>Changes to bus stop locations and layouts, including new bus stop bypasses for cyclists</li>
	<li>Changes to parking and loading bays and hours of operation</li>
</ul>

<p>This section of CS9 would provide a continuous, largely-segregated route between Kensington Olympia and Brentford town centre, via Hammersmith and Chiswick.</p>

<h3>Change of name</h3>

<p>Later in 2019 we will change the name of routes on our cycle network, replacing 'Cycle Superhighway' and 'Quietway'.</p>

<h2>Extension to Hounslow</h2>

<p>We are working closely with the London Borough of Hounslow to develop proposals to extend CS9 further west through Brentford and towards Hounslow.</p>
