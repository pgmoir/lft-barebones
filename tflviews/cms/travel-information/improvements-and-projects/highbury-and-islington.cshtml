        Work we're doing at Highbury Corner roundabout will make the area safer and more convenient for cyclists and pedestrians. We plan to complete our works in autumn 2019.
        
      </div>
    
    <div class="on-this-page">
      <p>We will:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pedestrianise the western arm of the roundabout</li>
	<li>Introduce two-way traffic</li>
	<li>Build segregated cycle lanes</li>
	<li>Build a public space with access to the arboretum</li>
</ul>

<p>Working closely with Islington Council, we will also create a new public space and larger station square by closing the western arm of the roundabout and improving access to the arboretum, while protecting existing trees.</p>

<p>Our works will:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Remove the one-way system and introduce two-way traffic with clear signals, road markings and signs to assist road users</li>
	<li>Close of the western side of the roundabout from the top of Upper Street to Holloway Road to all motorised vehicles and cyclists to create a new public space leading to Highbury and Islington station. We will redirect the main road to the other side of the arboretum (the green space in the centre of the roundabout)</li>
	<li>Relocate the pedestrian crossing at the junction with St Paul's Road closer to the junction itself, providing a more direct route for pedestrians</li>
	<li>Widen the pedestrian crossing at the junctions with Holloway Road, Canonbury Road and Upper Street. The pedestrian crossings at the Canonbury Road and Upper Street junctions will also be changed from two-stage crossings to straight-across crossings</li>
	<li>Introduce a new signalised pedestrian crossing at the junction with Canonbury Road</li>
	<li>Add <a href="/info-for/boroughs/legible-london">Legible London</a> signs to give pedestrians&nbsp;maps and other information to help them get around the area</li>
	<li>Introduce segregated cycle lanes in both directions on all three remaining sides of the road layout</li>
	<li>Install three new signalised cycle crossings at the junctions with Highbury Place, St Paul's Road and Canonbury Road, allowing cyclists, pedestrians and motorists to be separated</li>
	<li>Add Advanced Stop Lines (allowing cyclists to wait in front of motorists at traffic signals) on St Paul's Road and Highbury Place, with an early release signal for cyclists on St Paul's Road</li>
	<li>Introduce a northbound segregated cycle lane&nbsp;at Canonbury Road on the approach to the junction, and south and westbound mandatory cycle lanes at Holloway Road and St Paul's on the approach to the junction</li>
</ul>

<h2>A new public space</h2>


<p>We will create a new public space and larger station square by closing the western arm of the roundabout and giving access to the existing arboretum. Part of the arboretum will be opened to create a new green space although another part will stay closed to the public.</p>

<p>Features proposed for the new public space include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A new seating wall</li>
	<li>Granite cobbles in the footway to define the space</li>
	<li>A new circular timber bench</li>
	<li>A raised stone edge around the arboretum</li>
	<li>Railings around the closed arboretum area</li>
	<li>Seating blocks and bollards to separate pedestrians and vehicles</li>
	<li>Continuous footways linking the station forecourt area with the western arm</li>
	<li>New trees planted with Sustainable Urban Drainage system (SUDS).</li>
	<li>Legible London signs</li>
	<li>Water filling station</li>
	<li>New litter bins and lighting</li>
</ul>

<p>Highbury Corner is now operating with two-way traffic, with segregated cycle lanes. Motorists and cyclists can no longer:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Turn right from Upper Street into Canonbury Road</li>
	<li>Turn left from Canonbury Road into Upper Street</li>
</ul>

<p>The closure of the western side of the roundabout means that some local roads are also permanently closed to traffic:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Highbury Station Road</li>
	<li>Hampton Court</li>
	<li>Southern end of Corsica Street</li>
</ul>

<p>Drive carefully while pedestrians, cyclists and other traffic get used to the new two-way system. If you are walking,&nbsp;please use the pedestrian crossings and&nbsp;remember to look both ways.</p>

<h3>Until summer 2019</h3>

<p>We will be&nbsp;doing work on the carriageway until summer 2019. This will include building the pedestrianised area on the western side of Highbury Corner and finishing the segregated cycle lanes.</p>

<p>From summer until autumn 2019&nbsp;we will plant trees and improve lighting in the new pedestrianised space.</p>

<p>Essential works to replace and upgrade the old gas mains are also taking place on Canonbury Road until summer 2019. We are working with Cadent Gas to minimise disruptions.</p>

<p>Most works will take place from Monday-Friday, 08:00-17:00. Some weekend and night work will also be needed to finish the project as quickly as possible.</p>

<h3>Completed works</h3>

<p>We repaved the station forecourt outside Highbury &amp; Islington station. The pedestrian crossing there reopened in September 2018.</p>

<p>We also repaved the footways along Holloway Road -&nbsp;this included realigning the kerb and paving between Highbury Place and Corsica Street and between Upper Street and Canonbury Road. Similar work took place on Upper Street and Canonbury Road.</p>
</div>
 <div>

<h2>Changes to traffic movements</h2>

<p>To make the new road layout work, motorists and cyclists will no longer be able to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Turn right from Upper Street into Canonbury Road</li>
	<li>Turn left from Canonbury Road into Upper Street</li>
</ul>

<h2>Local road closures</h2>

<p>The closure of the western side of the roundabout means that some roads will permanently close to traffic:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Highbury Station Road</li>
	<li>Hampton Court</li>
</ul>

<p>We will also close the southern end of Corsica Street to&nbsp;motorists to help cyclists move through the junction and to remove any potential conflict between cyclists and other traffic turning into Corsica Street. This will also make it safer for pedestrians to cross at the junction.</p>

<h2>Parking changes/taxi ranks</h2>

<h3>Loading and disabled parking changes, and taxi rank provision</h3>

<ul>
	<li>A new 12-metre loading bay will be put in the edge of the new station square, opposite Highbury &amp; Islington station</li>
	<li>A new two-car taxi rank is also be included - it will operate daily 22:00-06:00. Highbury &amp; Islington station will be served by the Night Tube and the new taxi rank will support this</li>
	<li>We will move the loading bay and disabled parking bay on the northern side of the roundabout (in front of the Marie Curie building) to the new road edge. This will allow space for the proposed segregated cycle track. The bay will be shortened by six metres</li>
	<li>The loading bay at the top of Upper Street will be shortened by nine metres to accommodate the new road layout</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes to trees</h2>

<p>To make room for the new road layout we will need to remove some trees from the edge of the arboretum, as well as two from the northern side of the roundabout, three from the eastern side and one from the southern side &#45; up to 17 in total. Two will be replanted in another place. The memorial tree and mature tree on the corner of Compton Terrace will not be disturbed.</p>

<p>We will plant 22 more trees within the boundary of the arboretum and in the new pedestrianised area.</p>
</div>
 <div>

<h2>Consultation</h2>

<p>We held a joint consultation with Islington Council in early 2016 on proposed improvements to Highbury Corner and on changes to bus services.</p>

<p>Some of our proposals have since changed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The arboretum will be partially open to public access in a way that protects existing trees. The new public space will incorporate the western arm of the roundabout and Highbury &amp; Islington station forecourt, giving residents more green space while protecting the most vulnerable trees</li>
	<li>The new pedestrian crossing, allowing for access to the southeast corner of the arboretum at the junction of Upper Street with Canonbury Road, will no longer be needed. The proposal to partially open the arboretum on the western side means that the eastern half of the arboretum, including the option to open up a path from the southeastern corner, will no longer be needed</li>
	<li>The entrance to Corsica Street has been made a 'blended footway' providing a continuous footway over the junction to give pedestrians priority</li>
	<li>A shared pedestrian/cycle&nbsp;'toucan' crossing will be included across St Paul's Road to allow two-way cycling to and from Corsica Street</li>
	<li>The cycle lane on Canonbury Road will be extended to Canonbury School</li>
</ul>

<h2>Highbury Corner Bridge replacement</h2>

<p>Work is now complete on the Highbury Corner Bridge replacement.</p>

<p>The bridge was built around 1850 and carries the Holloway Road (A1) over the London Overground line. The bridge also sits under the Highbury &amp; Islington station building and forecourt.</p>

<p>The bridge was in a poor state of repair so it was essential it was replaced. This has prevented the need for disruptive emergency closures in the future.</p>

<p>The new bridge has an expected lifespan of 120 years.</p>
