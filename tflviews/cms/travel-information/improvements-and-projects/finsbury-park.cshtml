        Our work at Finsbury Park Tube station will provide step-free access, reduce congestion and improve security and safety. A new station entrance will open in late 2019.
        
      </div>
    
    
      <p>Two new lifts opened to the public in January 2019. They serve the northbound and southbound Victoria and Piccadilly line platforms, making the station step-free from street level to the trains.</p>

<p>We are working with City North Finsbury Park Ltd to open the new entrance accessed from Wells Terrace and Goodwin Street.</p>

<h3>Closure of Wells Terrace entrance</h3>
<p>The entrance to Finsbury Park Tube station from Wells Terrace is now closed.</p>
<p>Passengers can use other entrances to get into and exit the station. Walking from Wells Terrace to the station entrance at Station Place via Stroud Green Road takes just a few minutes based on average walking speed. The route will be well advertised.
</p>
<p>When it opens in 2019 the new, larger station entrance will be used from Wells Terrace or Goodwin Street. It will add a further step-free access route from street to the trains.</p>
