        We're improving cycling and walking facilities alongside the A40 Westway. Construction is scheduled to finish in December 2019.

      <p>The plans to make this area a safer, more appealing place to cycle and walk include a two-way cycle track next to the footpath running from Kathleen Avenue to Wood Lane.</p>

<h2>Our improvement plans</h2>

<p>The scheme should encourage people who want to walk or cycle to and from central London but currently feel unable to travel more actively. West London has been identified as an area of high demand for cycling but where better cycle facilities are needed.</p>

<p>The main proposed changes between Acton and Wood Lane include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Changes to make it safer and quicker to cross the southern side of the busy Savoy Circus junction</li>
	<li>Wider, raised crossings at the A40's junctions with Kathleen Avenue, Allan Way, Court Way and Park View</li>
	<li>Wider walking and cycling crossings at major junctions</li>
	<li>Improved shared-use footways on large sections of the southern side of the A40 Westway between Wood Lane and Savoy Circus</li>
	<li>1.8km of new protected two-way cycle track running next to the footpath between Kathleen Avenue and Savoy Circus - this will connect to the 1.6km shared-use footway to be built east of Savoy Circus to form a continuous cycle route</li>
</ul>

<p>The scheme would be part of London's expanding cycling network. This is an important part of the <a href="/corporate/about-tfl/the-mayors-transport-strategy">Mayor's Transport Strategy</a> and <a href="/corporate/about-tfl/how-we-work/planning-for-the-future/healthy-streets">Healthy Streets approach</a>, which aim to encourage walking, cycling and the use of public transport.</p>

<h2>Consultation</h2>

<p>We consulted on our plans in early 2016. A consultation report and a summary of design changes made since the consultation is available on the <a href="https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/cycling/east-west-phase-2/">East-West Cycle Superhighway consultation page</a>.</p>

<h2>Wood Lane to Notting Hill Gate</h2>

<p>We are working closely with Hammersmith &amp; Fulham and Kensington &amp; Chelsea councils to develop proposals that would link this scheme further east, connecting Wood Lane, Shepherd's Bush Green, Holland Park Avenue and Notting Hill Gate.</p>

<p>Our consultation on these proposals is open until Sunday 16 June 2019. See the proposals and find out how to have your say on the <a href="https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/roads/wood-lane-notting-hill/">Wood Lane and Notting Hill Gate consultation page</a>.</p>
