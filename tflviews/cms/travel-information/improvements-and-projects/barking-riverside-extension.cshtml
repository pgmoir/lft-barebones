        The Barking Riverside extension will add 4.5km to the London Overground Gospel Oak to Barking line, and take it from Barking to a new station at Barking Riverside. The main works contractor is now on site to begin construction, with train services starting during 2021.
        
      </div>
    
    
      <p>The extension - which includes 4.5km of new track - is one of several transport measures designed to serve the emerging development area at <a href="https://barkingriverside.co.uk/home/">Barking Riverside</a>.</p>

<p>Barking Riverside is the largest housing development in east London, with planning permission for up to 10,800 new homes, as well as healthcare, shopping, community and leisure facilities. Without a new rail link in place, the full potential of the development at Barking Riverside cannot be achieved.</p>

<p>The Barking Riverside extension will be capable of operating four trains per hour from Barking station along the existing Tilbury line used by c2c between Fenchurch Street and Grays. After passing under the Renwick Road bridge the extension would then head south to a new station in the heart of the Barking Riverside development.</p>

<h2>London Riverside Opportunity Area</h2>

<p>Barking Riverside is part of the London Riverside Opportunity Area. In September 2015 the GLA adopted an Opportunity Area Planning Framework (OAPF) for the London Riverside area, setting out how it will deliver over 26,000 new homes and 16,000 new jobs for London. More information is on the <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/implementing-london-plan/opportunity-areas/opportunity-areas/london-riverside">London Riverside page on the GLA website</a>.</p>

<h2>Benefits of the extension</h2>

<p>The extension would:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Enable construction of 10,800 homes at Barking Riverside, plus a new school, healthcare facilities and a new district centre with commercial and leisure facilities, high-quality public spaces and connections to walking and cycling routes</li>
	<li>Provide a transport link to Barking and, from there, the employment opportunities of central London, Isle of Dogs and Stratford</li>
	<li>Create reliable public transport within Barking Riverside</li>
	<li>Improve transport accessibility - Barking Riverside station would offer a step-free entry point to other London Overground services</li>
	<li>Offer a sustainable public transport alternative to car travel</li>
</ul>

<p>We are also working with Barking Riverside Limited on a series of transport improvements measures in the area, including bus network enhancements and the creation of a street network that promotes walking and cycling.</p>

<h2>Approval of the scheme</h2>

<p>A public inquiry into the scheme was held by an independent inspector in October 2016. After receiving the inspector's report, the Secretary of State for Transport granted powers for the extension on 4 August 2017.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/london-overground-barking-riverside-extension-order-inspectors-report">inspector's report</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/london-overground-barking-riverside-extension-order-decision">Secretary of State's decision letter</a> are on Gov.UK.</p>

<h3>Contractor appointment</h3>

<p>A notice was put with the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) asking for expressions of interest. Bidders who qualified through an initial selection stage received a formal Invitation to Tender (ITT) in spring 2018.</p>

<p>The contract has now been awarded to MSVF, a joint venture of <a href="https://construction.morgansindall.com">Morgan Sindall Construction &amp; Infrastructure Ltd</a> and <a href="https://www.volkerfitzpatrick.co.uk">VolkerFitzpatrick</a>. Under the contract, MSVF will deliver:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The 4.5km extension to Barking Riverside, from the Tilbury Loop Line between Barking and Dagenham Dock stations to Barking Riverside</li>
	<li>Reconfiguration of Network Rail's Ripple Lane goods yard to allow the extension to connect to the Tilbury Loop</li>
	<li>Construction of a viaduct over the Ripple Lane yard. The viaduct will have to be built over the Tilbury Loop and foundations constructed between the HS1 tunnels</li>
	<li>Continuation of the viaduct for a further 1.5km over Renwick Road and into the heart of Barking Riverside</li>
	<li>Construction of a new terminus station within the Barking Riverside town square. The station will have step-free access from street to train</li>
