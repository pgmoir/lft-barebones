<h2>Report roadworks</h2>
<p>You can report a <a href="/help-and-contact/report-roadworks">problem with a roadworks site</a> so we can take action or send your report to the relevant Highway Authority.</p>
<p>Report street faults (including traffic light faults) using our <a href="/help-and-contact/contact-us-about-streets-and-other-road-issues">online form</a>. Select <strong>Make a complaint</strong> and <strong>Streets</strong>.</p>
<ul></ul>
    <h2> Roadworks on LondonWorks</h2>
    <p>LondonWorks has information on current and planned roadworks taking place across the Capital.</p>
    <p>Find out:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Where roadworks are taking place</li>
        <li>How long the work will last</li>
        <li>Who is doing the work and how to contact them</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Visit the <a href="http://public.londonworks.gov.uk/">LondonWorks website</a>.</p>
    <p>LondonWorks is run by TfL in partnership with boroughs and utility companies.</p>
    <h2>TfL Lane Rental Scheme</h2>
    <p>The TfL Lane Rental Scheme (TLRS) was introduced in June 2012. It applies to the most traffic-sensitive locations and the most traffic-sensitive times of day, and covers 56% of the Transport for London Road Network (TLRN). </p>
    <p>The scheme is in place to incentivise behaviour change and minimise highway occupation, by applying a daily charge. <a href="/info-for/urban-planning-and-construction/our-land-and-infrastructure/lane-rental-scheme">Find out more about the Scheme</a>.</p>
    <h2>Code of Conduct for roadworks</h2>
    <p>The Mayor has worked with utility companies to establish a code of conduct that will cut the delays and congestion caused by roadworks.</p>
    <p>This was revised in June 2012, and now commits TfL, the six major utilities operating in London and all 33 London boroughs to specific targets that will reduce disruption from roadworks.</p>

<h2>Highway licences</h2>
<p>If you need to erect scaffolding, cranes or place skips or any other structure on any of the roads we look after, you will need to <a href="/info-for/urban-planning-and-construction/our-land-and-infrastructure/highway-licences">apply for a highway licence</a>.</p>
<h2>Licence to undertake street works</h2>
<p>If you need a licence to place or maintain apparatus in the highway, you'll need to apply for a section 50 licence under the New Road and Street Works Act 1991</p>
