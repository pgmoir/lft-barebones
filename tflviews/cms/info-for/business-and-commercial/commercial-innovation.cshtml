    <h3>Mayor's Civic Innovation</h3>

<p>We worked with the Mayor's Office on his inaugural Civic Innovation Challenge. The challenge looked for start-ups to develop ways to reduce inequality, prevent climate change and support London's ageing population.</p>

<p>The winners of the Mayor's Civic Innovation Challenge were announced on 1 October. Each has been given &pound;15,000 to jointly test and refine their ideas. We're now working with Go Jauntly to encourage more leisure time walking, and with VU.CITY and Crossmap to use our data to develop a housing analytics and visualisation platform.</p>

<h2>Working with us</h2>

<p>We are always looking for new ways we can work with companies wanting to innovate around transport and mobility.</p>

<p>If you're a corporate looking to launch a new future of mobility hub in London, a start-up or SME with a new business model in mobility, or an innovation accelerator, incubator or investor, please email us at <a href="mailto:innovation&#64;tfl.gov.uk">innovation&#64;tfl.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Our Innovation collaborations</h2>

<p>Our Commercial Innovation team is still relatively new and we're working hard to build our portfolio of collaborations to deliver benefits for all Londoners. Here's a sample of some of our latest collaborations:</p>

<h3>Bosch Connectory</h3>

<p>We're trialling an 18-month pilot partnership with Bosch to give small businesses and start-ups the opportunity to work with renowned experts and use cutting-edge data to tackle crucial transport challenges in London.</p>

<p>Bosch have opened a new 'Connectory' facility in Shoreditch, providing space and facilities for TfL and selected start-ups to work alongside Bosch's experts, along with private, academic and public sector partners.</p>

<p>The Connectory has a primary focus on urban mobility challenges facing Londoners, including innovations around more efficient, greener and safer vehicles, reducing congestion, improving accessibility and encouraging more people to walk, cycle and take public transport across the city.</p>

<p>We provide technical knowledge and a wide range of datasets based on&nbsp;our existing Unified API and open data platform to allow companies to test ideas and understand patterns in more detail. In return, Bosch dedicates professionals to provide technical expertise, guidance and mentoring.</p>

<p>Further details will be released soon by Bosch on their plans to consider direct approaches by small business/start ups who want to be part of the Connectory community.</p>

<h3>Waze</h3>

<p>We partner with Waze to share data and provide useful and relevant information to our customers. Most recently, we used their platform to remind drivers approaching the Blackwall Tunnel to refuel before entering the tunnel. As a result, we saw a significant increase in Waze users re-route to a nearby petrol station, drastically reducing the risk of breakdowns from fuel.</p>
