<p>Bus passengers will experience shorter journey times as a result of a small re-routing to the 35, 37 and N35.</p>
<p>Currently these routes run along Clapham Common North Side and The Pavement in the eastbound direction. </p>
<p>From Saturday 26 May, all three routes will run through Long Road onto Clapham Common Southside and Clapham Park Road, as they do in the westbound direction. </p>
<p>This will mean a simpler bus service and will enable passengers to better interchange with other services at Clapham Common South Side.</p>
<p>There are no other changes to any other bus services in the area. </p>
