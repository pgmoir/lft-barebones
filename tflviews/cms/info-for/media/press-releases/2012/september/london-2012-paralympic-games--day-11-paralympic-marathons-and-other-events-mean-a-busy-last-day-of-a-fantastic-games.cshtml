<p>Tomorrow (Sunday 9 September) sees the final day of competition in what has been a truly fantastic Paralympic Games. </p>
<p>The Paralympic Marathon events start and finish at The Mall, with Dave Weir and Shelly Woods continuing the push for Gold. </p>
<p>With seven-a-side Football and Wheelchair Rugby at the Olympic Park, and the Mayor's Thames Festival continuing, it will be another busy and exciting day in London.</p>
<p>Stations near the Mall, Bank, Embankment, the City and Tower Hill are expected to be busy leading up to and after the men's and women's Paralympic Marathons.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Mayor's Thames Festival</h2>
<p>Local bus services will be affected with some routes shortened or diverted, and drivers are advised to avoid the route. </p>
<p>Central London will be busy, and roads including the Victoria Embankment will be closed for the finishing parade of the Mayor's Thames Festival.</p>
<p>Transport for London (TfL) is asking customers and road users to continue taking the same sensible steps they did during the Olympics - avoiding the busiest times and places and planning ahead. </p>
<p>The Jubilee line from Waterloo to Stratford, the Central line from Holborn to Stratford, the DLR network, and the Javelin service, will be particularly busy in the afternoon and late evening as spectators head to and from the Olympic Park and return home from the Closing Ceremony.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stratford station is expected to be very busy from 17:30.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Leave extra travel time</h2>
<p>These stations should be avoided during peak times unless going to a Paralympic event.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Stations close to the Live Site in Trafalgar Square are also expected to be very busy. Spectators heading to or from the Olympic Park should consider using c2c, District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines to or from West Ham instead and they can access the Park via the Greenway, or National Rail services between Liverpool Street and Stratford.&nbsp; Passengers with reduced mobility should use Stratford station, where assistance is available.</p>
<p>All passengers are advised to leave extra travel time and to plan ahead to avoid the busiest times and places by visiting GetAheadoftheGames.com. </p>
<p>TfL continues to remind people that, where possible they should avoid driving on or around the Paralympic Route Network (PRN) and near venue areas, particularly around the Olympic Park in Stratford and the A102 approach roads north and south of the Blackwall Tunnel.&nbsp; </p>
<p>However, the PRN to the Royal Artillery Barracks and Greenwich Park is no longer in operation.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Summer of sport</h2>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE, said: 'Tomorrow will bring a fantastic summer of sport in the Capital to a close as we witness the last of the Paralympics action followed by the Closing Ceremony.</p>
<p>'We hugely appreciate how Londoners have adapted their travel patterns this summer to plan ahead and avoid the busiest times and places. </p>
<p>'We're asking everyone to continue this tomorrow, which is set to be busy, and on Monday when the Athlete's Parade will give Londoners and visitors the great opportunity to see our remarkable Olympic and Paralympic teams celebrate their amazing achievements and to celebrate the role of the volunteers too.'</p>
