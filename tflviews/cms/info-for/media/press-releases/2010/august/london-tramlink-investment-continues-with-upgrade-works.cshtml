            <p>The work which will take place on the central Croydon 'loop' of the tram network is primarily to replace 110 metres of rails although other related maintenance and upgrade work will also be carried out.</p>
<p>TfL's Director of London Trams, Phil Hewitt said: 'Our Tramlink upgrade programme is essential work and will result in passengers getting a smoother ride with less disruption to their journeys in the future.</p>
<p>'Tramlink is now&nbsp;10 years old and the works are needed to replace rails nearing the end of their working life.</p>
<p>'I would like to thank in advance Croydon residents, businesses and tram passengers for their patience during the upgrade. We have taken every step possible to minimise inconvenience to them.'</p>
<p>All works have been discussed and agreed with the London Borough of Croydon. </p>
<p>Tram services on the 'loop' section of the network which connects Reeves Corner, Centrale, West Croydon, Wellesley Road, East Croydon, George Street and Church Street tram stops, will be suspended from 21 August to 30 August. </p>
<p>Tram services will run on all other sections of the network during that period and tram tickets and Oyster cards will be accepted on all buses which follow routes around the central Croydon section.</p>
<p><strong>Notes to editors</strong></p><strong></strong>
