        <p>Stamford
        Bridge, Chelsea's iconic football ground, Craven Cottage, home of Fulham FC,
        and the Kia Oval, one of the world's most famous cricket grounds, are just some
        of the sporting venues sports fans can enjoy on a new self-guided Barclays
        Cycle Hire route.&nbsp;
        Running
        along the river from Hammersmith in West London, through Battersea Park to
        Kennington in south London, the ride uses mainly quiet roads which are
        especially suitable for leisure cyclists and tourists.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Tracing the River Thames, the route also follows part of the
        Oxford and Cambridge&nbsp;university boat race, one of the oldest sporting
        events in the world.&nbsp; There is even the chance to relive the London 2012
        Games by peddling along a section of the Olympic Cycling Road Race route.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Cycle
        hire users can pick up a free copy of Transport for London's (TfL) &quot;Explore
        London with Barclays Cycle Hire&quot; map at central London Tube stations and London
        Overground stations. Other popular routes in the new colour-coded guide
        include: Quirky London, London's secret gardens, Saturday markets and
        Independent shops and markets.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Nick
        Aldworth, General Manager for Barclays Cycle Hire at TfL, said: &quot;From famous
        football grounds to quirky Saturday markets, our self-guided cycling routes are
        a great way to see London differently this summer.&nbsp; With docking stations
        along the ride you can dock your Barclays Cycle Hire bike when you want to take
        a break to admire the fantastic sports venues and sights.&nbsp; It's the
        perfect way to discover London.&quot;
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Ron
        Gourlay, Chief Executive of Chelsea Football Club, said: &quot;Stamford Bridge is
        famous the world over as the home of Chelsea FC and we're very happy to open
        our home to the cyclists of this new route to enjoy a tour of our stadium,
        experience our museum and dine in one of our restaurants.&quot;
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Sarah Brookes, Communications Director at Fulham Football Club,
        said:
        &quot;Craven Cottage is steeped in history, from the wonderful listed
        facade designed by Archibald Leitch, the beautiful bronze statue of the first
        &pound;100 a week footballer Johnny Haynes, to the Cottage itself, there is so much
        to see. The caf&eacute; at Craven Cottage is a great place to relax and unwind either
        at the end of a leisurely cycle ride, or as a resting point before continuing
        the journey along the route.&quot;
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Richard Gould, Chief Executive
        at Surrey County Cricket Club / the Kia Oval, said: &quot;Barclays Cycle Hire has
        been one of the best innovations in London transport over recent years and we
        are delighted to be so well served by docking stations.
        &nbsp;
        &quot;The Kia Oval was where the
        first FA Cup Final was staged, where England scored their first ever goal and
        where England scored their first ever try. It seems very appropriate therefore
        that people should combine a visit here with trips to Craven Cottage and
        Stamford Bridge, important and historic venues in their own right.&quot;
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>People
        can hire Barclays Cycle Hire bikes from as little as &pound;2 for 24 hour bike access
        which includes unlimited journeys under 30 minutes. Users simply need to
        go to a docking station with a credit or debit card and touch the screen to get
        started. There is no need to book, simply hire a bike, ride it, and then return
        it to any docking station across the capital, ready for the next rider.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Large parts of southwest London are
        now accessible by Barclays Cycle Hire after the area covered by the scheme
        expanded by more than 50 per cent in December 2013.</p>

            <li>The
            Sporting Sights cycling route was created by British Cycling, the other routes
            in the new map were supplied by the London Cycle Blog</li>
            <li>There
            are currently over 10,000 Barclays Cycle Hire bikes across London with over
            19,000 docking points available. The scheme, which is already the second
            largest cycle hire system in Europe, last month celebrated 30 million journeys
            since its launch and remains an affordable and enjoyable way to travel around
            London</li>
            <li>The
            Tour de France &#45; the world's largest annual sporting event &#45; returns to London
            on Monday 7 July. After two stages in Yorkshire, around 200 elite cyclists will
            travel from Cambridge, through Essex, into London before a spectacular finish
            on The Mall. The Tour de France will draw people onto the streets of London
            from near and far, and help to inspire more people to take up cycling in the
            capital</li>
            <li>The
            Tour de France is followed by two more exciting cycling events in London -
            Prudential RideLondon on 9 and 10 August and the Tour of Britain, which takes
            place between 7 and 14 September and traditionally finishes in the capital</li>
