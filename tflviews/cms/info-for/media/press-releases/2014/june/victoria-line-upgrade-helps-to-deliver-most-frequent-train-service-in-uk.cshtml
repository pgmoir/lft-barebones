            <li>Victoria line passengers now have
            34 trains per hour at busiest times &#45; less than two minutes between trains</li>
            <li>Additional capacity when it is
            needed most for thousands of extra passengers during peak hours
            </li>
            <li>Northern line services also
            boosted as new signalling introduced as part of modernisation programme</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Passengers on the Victoria line are now benefitting from the most
        frequent train service in the UK &#45; up to 34 trains per hour. </p>
        <p>The service, which
        means customers wait less than two minutes between trains arriving on platforms
        in peak times, will provide additional capacity for thousands of extra
        passengers. More trains are now running the full length of the line from
        Brixton up to Walthamstow Central to cater for the increase in customer numbers
        at the north end of the line.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The weekend influx of shoppers, tourists and regular travellers
        will also benefit from increased services on Saturday afternoons, with a train
        every two and a quarter minutes. On Sundays customers will have a train every
        two and half minutes throughout the day from 9am and through the evening until
        10pm.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Following London Underground's completed upgrade of the Victoria
        line in 2012, which has seen the introduction of state-of-the-art signalling
        and a brand new fleet of trains, the service during the rush hour has risen
        from 28 trains per hour, to 30, 33 and now to 34 trains per hour, giving
        customers, faster, more reliable and more comfortable journeys.
        &nbsp;
        As the modernisation of the Northern line nears completion later
        this year, London Underground is already using the new signalling system to
        increase the frequency of services. The Northern line is now running 22 trains
        per hour during the busiest morning and evening peak hours &#45; up from 20 per
        hour that have been run previously. The off peak service has now been boosted
        from 16 trains per hour to 18 trains per hour on
        weekdays and weekends, reflecting the sizeable increase in more people using
        the Tube at weekends.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: &quot;Thanks to state of the art
        signalling and a brand new fleet of trains, the Victoria line now holds a
        national badge of honour as the most frequent train service in the UK. From Brixton
        to Walthamstow Central we've got more services running up and down this famous
        blue line, plus more frequent trains at weekends to ferry an ever growing
        number of shoppers, tourists and regular travellers. Passengers are starting to
        see the benefits of increased services and capacity on other major Tube lines
        too, with modernisation on the Northern line also now edging towards
        completion. With plans on track to reduce delays by 30 per cent by the end of
        2015, this is all part of our mission to invest in and deliver improvements
        across the Tube, to keep London and its economy moving.&quot;
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Phil Hufton, London Underground's Chief Operating Officer, said:
        &quot;TfL's investment programme, which includes new trains and signalling has
        resulted in more capacity for Victoria and Northern line customers. The
        Victoria line is now operating the most frequent service in the UK with up to
        34 trains per hour &#45; less than two minutes between trains in the vital morning
        and evening rush hours and comparable with any service across Europe.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>On the Victoria line, as well as more frequent services, the passengers &#45; more
        than 200 million -&nbsp; who use the line each year have new higher capacity
        trains, which&nbsp; are more accessible with wider doors and more spaces for
        wheelchair users, on-board audio and visual electronic information for hard of
        hearing and visually impaired passengers and CCTV in every carriage.
        &nbsp;
        Platform humps &#45; platform sections raised for the full length of a
        carriage &#45; have been installed in Victoria line stations to give level access
        between the platform and the train, making it easier for wheelchair users,
        parents with buggies and passengers with luggage to board and alight from trains.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The line upgrades are at the core of TfL's investment programme,
        which will deliver more than 30 per cent increase in capacity. The upgrade
        programme is being delivered over the coming years, with work on upgrades to
        the Northern, Circle, District, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan lines
        well underway.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Redevelopment work to increase capacity at key stations and make
        them step-free, is already underway at a number of stations including Victoria,
        Tottenham Court Road and Bond Street, which is also an important part of TfL's
        investment programme. More than half of London Underground's 270 stations have
        now been modernised or refurbished to make them brighter and easier to use,
        with improvements such as tactile strips and better CCTV and help points,
        electronic information displays in ticket halls and on platforms, and improved
        seating and lighting.</p>
