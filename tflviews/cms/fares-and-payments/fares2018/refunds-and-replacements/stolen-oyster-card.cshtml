        You can transfer pay as you go credit, Travelcards and/or Bus & Tram Passes to a new Oyster card if your registered Oyster card was stolen.

      <h2>Before you replace your card</h2>
<p>You must have pay as you go credit, or at least 5 days travel remaining on a Travelcard or Bus &amp; Tram Pass, for us to transfer it to a new Oyster card.</p>
<p>Your stolen card must have been registered.</p>
<p>Be ready to provide a copy of the crime reference report.</p>
<h2>Replace your card by phone</h2>
<p>Call:<br />
<a href="tel:0343 222 1234">0343 222 1234</a> (<a href="/corporate/terms-and-conditions/tfl-call-charges">Charges may apply</a>)</p>
<p>It will take us up to 5 working days after you've reported your Oyster card as stolen to send you a replacement. </p>
<p>Once we have confirmed you're the registered Oyster card owner, we will calculate the pay as you go balance, or Travelcard/Bus &amp; Tram Pass value, from the day you reported it as stolen and transfer to your replacement card. </p>
<p>We don't refund your travel costs whilst you're waiting for your new card to arrive.</p>
<p>If it takes us longer than 5 working days to replace your card, we might refund any travel made from the sixth day. You would need to provide receipts or tickets.</p>
<p>Once you've reported your card as stolen, the card will be cancelled.</p>
<h2>After you get your new card</h2>
<p>Your new Oyster card will have the same Travelcard, Bus &amp; Tram Pass and/or pay as you go credit that was on it before.</p>
<p>Before adding your new card to your contactless and Oyster account, you need to make at least one journey with it and then wait 24 hours.</p>
<p>If you have an Annual Travelcard, we'll send you a new Gold Record Card.</p>
<p>If you get discounted travel, you'll need to get the discount reset on your replacement card at a station.  You'll need to take your discount photocard with you. </p>
