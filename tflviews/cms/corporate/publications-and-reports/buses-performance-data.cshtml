      <h2>Measuring performance</h2>
<p>We measure network performance by comparing the number of kilometres a route has done in the last quarter. </p>
<p>We compare each quarter to the same quarter of the previous year,
rather than the last quarter of the same year. This is because factors
affecting performance, like traffic conditions, can vary depending on
the time of year, so this system makes it possible to identify
underlying trends.</p>
<p>Scheduled kilometres may not be met because journeys are cancelled or suspended due to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Traffic congestion</li>
    <li>Staff availability</li>
    <li>Engineering problems or mechanical breakdown</li>
</ul>
<p>Quality of service indicators (QSI) are used to monitor service reliability.</p>
<h2>Customer satisfaction</h2>
<p>We ask a sample of passengers to give a score out of 100 on a wide
range of bus service features, based on the journey they have just made. Passengers are carefully selected each quarter to represent all bus passengers in London.</p>
<p>Recent figures can be found in the latest quarter summary document below.
</p>
<h2>Defining the passenger journey</h2>
<p>A passenger journey is defined as one ride on a single vehicle - not a bus trip from A to B as this may include more than one bus ride.</p>
<p>Statistics include all London Buses' contracted services but exclude
any non-scheduled kilometres, London Service Permit routes and other
special services.</p>

<h2>Bus speeds reports</h2>


<p>We monitor the speeds of buses to understand the impacts of changing road network conditions. Bus speeds include time spent stationary (for example at traffic lights and at bus stops). Bus speeds are available for the entire network, by borough, and by route.</p>
<ul>
    <li>All data is in miles per hour</li>
    <li>All AM data is taken for Mondays to Fridays, School and Non School days, between 07:00 and 10:00</li>
    <li>At Route level, some routes may be appear twice. This is because a service change happened during a period. A service change may include a change to a route structure, contract or operator</li>

<h2>Factors affecting performance</h2>

<h3>Quarter 3 2018/19: 15 September 2018 to 4 January 2019</h3>

<p>Operated mileage results were slightly worse than Q3 a year ago though losses due to traffic delays are generally being maintained at the lowest levels seen for twenty years. Included in the reasons for this are improved operating conditions arising from a reduction in roadworks, improved signal timings and a slowing of economic growth. However, events causing significant delays to buses in the quarter included industrial action on the London Underground, climate change protests over several days, a series of demonstrations by taxi drivers, a bus garage fire and various burst water mains and emergency works. Lost kilometres due to mechanical and staff reasons were both higher compared with a year ago, the latter being impacted by industrial action at a contracted bus operator.</p>

<p>Until 2017/18, average bus speeds had been in consistent decline. The deterioration has started to reverse over the past 21 months, although speeds remain much slower than in 2014. Overall bus speeds in Q3 were close to the position a year ago as was the inner/outer London split. The Inner SW area showed a particular improvement whilst Outer SE deteriorated (but still had the highest average speed of any area).</p>

<p>Compared with Q3 a year ago, EWT has deteriorated slightly but is still showing some of the best ever results. Inner SW London has shown a particular improvement whilst Outer SW stayed the same and all other areas deteriorated slightly. Punctuality of low frequency services was slightly worse than the same quarter a year ago, but night buses departing on time has improved</p>

<h2>International Bus Benchmarking Group</h2>


<p>London is a member of the International Bus Benchmarking Group (IBBG), an international knowledge sharing network of bus companies. It was established in 2004 and is facilitated by Imperial College London.</p>
<p>Benchmarking is a continuous systematic process for evaluating the products, services, processes or organisations that are recognised as representing best practice for the purpose of organisational improvement. A blend of operational and customer metrics are used to track the performance of the bus network.</p>
<p>Every year, a review of buses performance monitoring is evaluated internally and presented to TfL's Independent Investment Programme Advisory Group (IIPAG) by Imperial College London to justify expenditure and ensure quality of service provided to passengers.
