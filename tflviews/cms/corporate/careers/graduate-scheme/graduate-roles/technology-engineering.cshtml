<p>Our Tech &amp; Data teams focus on what's behind the millions of daily transactions on London's transport network. As a Technology Analyst, you will gain hands-on experience across the skill sets involved in the entire delivery life-cycle. This will include exposure to business analysis techniques, practical product management, solution build and testing. You may also gain exposure to more specialist activities such as UX design and systems integration.</p>
<h2>What you'll be doing</h2>
<p>As a graduate, your two-year development programme will be made up of up to four placement rotations. Our aim is to equip you with the range of skills and experience you need for your successful career. We also understand that everyone's career is different, so every graduate's journey is unique.</p>
<p>Here's an idea of what yours could look like:</p>
<h3>Year 1</h3>
<p><strong>Placement 1 &#45; Business Analysis Team &#45; 6 months</strong><br />
Understanding stakeholder engagement, requirements gathering and process mapping.</p>
<p><strong>Placement 2 &#45; Product Management &#45; 6 months</strong><br />
Understanding product development, sponsorship delivery and identifying customer needs</p>
<h3>Year 2</h3>
<p>You have the option to choose where to go for your two final placements in the second year of the programme. These could be in an area such as Cyber Security, Business Development or as a Product Manager in a different area.  There are about 20 product teams in Tech &amp; Data, as well as the Business Analysts Team and wider strategy departments to choose from. This scheme will help you develop a broad foundation of skills you can choose to refine and explore in your career.</p>
<h2>What we look for</h2>
<p>Everything we do as an organisation is to ensure that our evolving city remains future-proof for millions of Londoners. Our talented graduates form a vital part of that vision, so it's important that we find the best people to help us do this.</p>
<p>We're looking for people who:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Are flexible when dealing with the unexpected</li>
    <li>Relish a challenge</li>
    <li>Inquisitive mind</li>
</ul>
<p>As a member of the team, we'll give you responsibility and the opportunity to add value from day one.  If you are excited by inspiring and influencing the future of London and are up for a challenge and thrive under pressure, then this is the career path for you.</p>
<h2>Where you can take your career</h2>
<p>Upon completion of the scheme you could become a Business Analyst, Cyber Security Analyst or a Product Analyst. In five years, you could be a Senior Business Analyst, Team Leader, Business Architect, Product Manager, Senior Cyber Security Analyst or Data Scientist.  TfL is a large organisation and the breadth of the Technology Analyst means there are many opportunities to progress in ten years, both in the wider T&amp;D department and as a potential.</p>
<h2>How we'll develop and support you</h2>
<p>Whilst on the scheme, we'll support your technical development through a wide range of on-the-job practical experiences and placements.  We'll also support your professional development through a combination of classroom-led training courses, online training courses, mentoring opportunities and structured networking opportunities with scheme alumni. You will receive one-to-one support throughout the programme from your scheme sponsor and your Line Manager. You'll also be connected to a 'buddy' who will be an alumnus from the scheme.</p>

    <h2>Meet the Graduate</h2>
<p>&quot;My experience on the TfL Graduate scheme has been positive, as it has allowed me the flexibility to explore many different parts of the company and work on a variety of interesting challenges, such as our School Party Travel Scheme, Commercial Reporting, machine learning projects in operational areas and process improvement. </p>
<p>I've learned a lot about all the different facets of a transport network from many different perspectives, all within a very supportive team of business analysts&quot;</p>

    <h2>Beyond the graduate scheme</h2>
<p>&quot;The TfL Graduate scheme proved an invaluable launchpad for my career. Over the course of two years I was given the accountability to deliver within high profile programmes including the roll out of Wi-Fi to London Underground stations and preparing the underpinning IT systems to support the new Elizabeth Line. The skills, knowledge and experience I obtained enable me to rise to the different challenges presented in an ever evolving technologically driven organisation.&quot;</p>
