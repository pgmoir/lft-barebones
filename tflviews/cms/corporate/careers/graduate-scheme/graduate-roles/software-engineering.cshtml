<p>At TfL, Every Journey Matters and every line (of code) matters.  Our accelerated software development scheme enables you to become a full-stack .NET developer, whilst gaining experience on some of London's largest and most innovative software systems. Your software will keep London moving in one of the biggest Agile technology teams, with a reputation for delivering high quality and innovative software. Whether you're looking to develop your skillset using Agile, .NET, Azure, SQL, Web, Mobile Apps, Test Driven Development &#45; TfL are doing it all right here, improving the lives of millions of Londoners every day.</p>
<h2>What you'll be doing</h2>
<p>As a graduate, this one year development programme will be made up of up to three placement rotations. Our aim is to equip you with the range of skills and experience you need for your successful career. We also understand that everyone's career is different, so every graduate's journey is unique. </p>
<p>Here's an idea of what yours could look like:</p>
<p><strong>Placement 1 &#45; Backend Developer</strong><br />
Working on our ticketing systems, you will design and implement a high performance Microsoft C# component to process 20 million Oyster &amp; Contactless transactions per day.  You'll also learn best practices such as Test Driven Development, Behaviour Driven Development and Continuous Integration to deliver high quality, clean code.</p>
<p><strong>Placement 2 &#45; Online developer</strong><br />
Use Microsoft's Azure cloud to deliver highly scalable software services which deliver data reliably and securely to our web and mobile applications.  With guidance directly from Microsoft engineers, you learn how to select the right technology from their ever-changing range of products.  Find out how to test and optimise the performance of components before they're released and then how to monitor the live systems for any issues.</p>
<p><strong>Placement 3 &#45; Mobile App Developer</strong><br />
Write native Android &amp; iOS applications which help customers navigate our network and manage their TfL accounts.  Evaluate development tools and setup fully automated build, test and deployment pipelines using Visual Studio Team Services.</p>
<p>During the scheme, we encourage you to become a TfL STEM Ambassadors and help with our schools outreach programme which delivers inspiring workshops to primary and secondary schools on topics such as coding &amp; big data.</p>
<p>Your first placement will be fixed and your following placements will be mutually agreed to ensure you gain experience on the widest possible range of technologies, tools and teams.</p>
<h2>What we look for</h2>
<p>Everything we do as an organisation is to ensure that our evolving city remains future-proof for millions of Londoners. Our talented graduates form a vital part of that vision, so it's important that we find the best people to help us do this. </p>
<p>We're looking for people who:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Are fascinated by new technologies and motivated to learn</li>
    <li>Enjoy sharing knowledge, both receiving &amp; giving</li>
    <li>Are Intrigued by new problems and refinement of the solution</li>
</ul>
<p>As a member of the team, we'll give you responsibility and the opportunity to add value from day one.  If you are excited by inspiring and influencing the future of London and are up for a challenge and thrive under pressure, then this is the career path for you.</p>
<h2>Where you can take your career</h2>
<p>Upon completing the scheme, we would expect you to roll-off into a Developer position, responsible for delivering discrete software stories within a Scrum team, which meet business requirements, are fully tested and meet our standards for code quality.   In five years, you could expect to be a Technical Lead, accountable for a single team's software design and implementation, including setting the quality standard or a Software Development Manager, accountable for multiple delivery teams, strategic plans around architecture and process and budgeting multi-million pound projects.</p>
<h2>How we'll develop and support you</h2>
<p>Whilst on the scheme, we'll support your technical development through a wide range of on-the-job practical experiences and placements.  We'll also support your professional development through a combination of classroom-led training courses, online training courses, mentoring opportunities and structured networking opportunities with scheme alumni. You will receive one-to-one support throughout the programme from your scheme sponsor and your Line Manager. You'll also be connected to a 'buddy' who will be an alumnus from the scheme.</p>

    <h2>Beyond the graduate scheme</h2>
<p>&quot;I chose to join the graduate scheme at TfL as I was very excited at the prospect of working on systems such as Contactless Payments. I was also drawn to the work life balance, as well as the promise of a varied experience by seeing different areas of the company. </p>
<p>My biggest achievement since completing the graduate scheme is having the opportunity to present the work I undertook in my final placement at Google in partnership with the Department for Transport.&quot;</p>
