<h2>Programme overview</h2>
<p>The Stuart Ross BAME Press Office Internship is a diversity initiative targeted at students of African, Afro-Caribbean, Asian or Chinese origin (or a combination of the above) who are studying or have recently graduated. These groups are under-represented regionally, and nationally, in PR which is why we created this scheme in 2006.</p>
<p>In 2016, the internship was renamed the Stuart Ross BAME Internship after our former director of news Stuart Ross, who passed away in January 2016 after a battle with cancer. Stuart was a passionate supporter of the scheme from its inception and a key part of its success to date.</p>
<h3>What will you be doing in this role?</h3>

<p>From the beginning of your internship, you'll be involved in handling the big stories of the day affecting London's transport and delivering dedicated stories and campaigns. </p>
<p>
You'll learn all the skills you need to work in public relations, from writing press releases, dealing with journalists and managing media interviews to generating ideas for high profile campaigns and organising media events.</p>

<h3>Where can this career take me?</h3>
<p>This programme has been highly successful, and our interns have gone on to work in PR and communications roles in TfL, as well as the Metropolitan Police, the NHS, local government and the Arts Council.</p>
<h3>What training and support will you get?</h3>
<p>Training is important, so we will encourage you to attend a range of internal and external training courses to support your development, including social media, crisis communications and campaign planning.</p>
<p>Once you've finished your internship, ongoing employment with us would be based on the success of your application through our usual competitive recruitment processes.</p>
