<strong>Location:</strong>	London<br />
<strong>Salary</strong>: Starts from &pound;18,624<br />
<strong>Eligibility criteria:</strong> <br />
5 GCSE's A*-C (or equivalent) including maths and English language. You are not eligible for this scheme if you currently hold or are working towards a Level 4, 5, 6, 7, HND/C or degree qualification. You are not eligible for this scheme if you currently hold or are working towards a qualification at the same or higher level in a related subject and content from the qualification of this scheme. You must be 17 years of age by 1st September of the year in which you apply, to be eligible for this scheme.</p>
<h3>What will I be doing?</h3>
<p>During this scheme you'll learn aspects of the signalling infrastructure used on the underground from the trackside and train-borne equipment to the strategic need of signalling safety to enable the safe passage of trains and the carriage of our many customers.</p>
<p>The safe movement of trains is the lifeblood of the city, learning and contributing to how we enable the safe and efficient carriage of the public allowing them carry out their daily activities bringing wealth to the nation.</p>
<h3>What will the programme involve?</h3>
<p>You'll complete a number of placements whilst on the scheme that will develop you into a fully rounded signalling design engineer. Placements will include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Signal Maintenance department within the operational side of the London Underground.  In this placement you will learn how maintenance is organised within LU and how interrelationships operate between project teams renewing assets and LU departments such as fleet and stations who directly interact with the public users of the service.</li>
    <li>Signalling Engineering - Work within this team consists of strategic and associated aspects of signalling control. Within this placement you'll gain a basic knowledge of the disciplines supporting railway signalling design.</li>
    <li>Major Projects - With this placement you'll gain an insight into the delivery of a new and novel signalling system on a large scale. You'll have the opportunity to interact with an international signalling system supplier and wider LU stakeholders such as the maintainer and operator.</li>
    <li>Signalling Design - In this placement you'll learn the principles of signalling design and commence your progression towards the achievement of an IRSE license.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What training and support will I get?</h3>
<p>For the duration of the scheme you'll have a business sponsor that is responsible for the design and delivery of the apprenticeship scheme. They will help secure the right placements for you and support you in your professional development. You'll also have a mentor that'll support and guide you sharing their knowledge and expertise. Finally you can expect to have a buddy, either a previous apprentice or graduate from this scheme. Your buddy can answer any day to day questions you have and share their experiences with you.</p>
<p>During the scheme you'll not only complete the qualification but also have opportunities to complete additional training courses. These will vary from soft skills training to technical skills training. Your sponsors and placement managers will ensure you attend all the relevant training to support you in your role.</p>
<h3>What do we look for?</h3>
<p>You will be highly motivated and proactive, with a passion for engineering. If you're a logical thinker with a strong ability to problem solve to tackle technical challenges then this scheme is the perfect way to kick start your career.</p>
<h3>Where can this career take me?</h3>
<p>On completion of the apprentice scheme you'll aim to become part of the signalling design team, designing modifications to the existing signalling arrangements and contributing to the introduction of new signalling system. The current Director of Engineering and Major Projects Director for TfL both started as a technician apprentices so it can be seen that the apprentices can aspire eventually to senior management positions.</p>
