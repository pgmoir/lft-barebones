      <p><strong>Apprenticeship level:</strong>	3<br />
<strong>Approximate scheme length:</strong>	2 years<br />
<strong>Location:</strong>	London<br />
<strong>Salary:</strong> Starts from &pound;18,624<br />
<strong>Eligibility criteria:</strong><br />
5 GCSE's A*-C (or equivalent) including maths and English language. You are not eligible for this scheme if you currently hold or are working towards a Level 4, 5, 6, 7, HND/C or degree qualification. You are not eligible for this scheme if you currently hold or are working towards a qualification at the same or higher level in a related subject and content from the qualification of this scheme. You must be 18 years of age by 1st September of the year in which you apply, to be eligible for this scheme.</p>
<p><strong>What will I be doing?</strong></p>
<p>You will be supported by experienced building surveyors to provide the wider property management group with reasoned advice to ensure their ongoing maintenance and to maximise development opportunities within retail, commercial and residential sectors.<br />
You will be able to identify building defects and advise on cost effective and appropriate solutions, to identify risks and opportunities. Your role will support the wider team providing advice on a range of construction related issues from routine maintenance to major station redevelopments.</p>
<p><strong>What will the scheme involve?</strong></p>
<p>During your first year in commercial property you will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Develop an understanding of property, including refits, facilities and compliance</li>
    <li>Play a key role in ensuring that TfL properties are in good order and maintained</li>
    <li>Have the opportunity to work alongside the commercial revenue team to deliver projects, which could include creating new commercial and retail space and working with developers and retailers to approve plans.</li>
</ul>
<p>The scheme will also provide you with an opportunity to get involved in project management, where you will see building and construction projects progress from initial feasibility stage through to delivery and handover.</p>
<h3>What training and support will I get?</h3>
<p>For the duration of the scheme you'll have a business sponsor that is responsible for the design and delivery of the apprenticeship scheme. They will help secure the right placements for you and support you in your professional development. You'll also have a mentor that'll support and guide you sharing their knowledge and expertise. Finally you can expect to have a buddy, either a previous apprentice or graduate from this scheme. Your buddy can answer any day to day questions you have and share their experiences with you.</p>
<p>During the scheme you'll not only complete the qualification but also have opportunities to complete additional training courses. These will vary from soft skills training to technical skills training. Your sponsors and placement managers will ensure you attend all the relevant training to support you in your role.</p>
<h3>What do we look for?</h3>
<p> You will be enthusiastic with the ability to work independently and show initiative. You'll relish the opportunity to work in a role with a wide number of teams so team work and communication are vital.  You'll be working with large corporations or members of the public and it's important that you can build trust with your clients, as a chartered building surveyor.</p>
<h3>Where can this career take me?</h3>
<p>On successful completion  candidates can progress to become a chartered building surveyor, where you could be responsible for developing and maintaining TfL properties. The scheme also provides you with an opportunity to move into a project management role, where you could be involved in exciting construction projects.</p>
