        Working in finance is about much more than crunching numbers. It's about looking beyond numbers and spreadsheets in order to add real value to a company. TfL's finance team plays a crucial role in achieving our main business objective; to keep London moving, working and growing and make life in our city better.

      <p><strong>Apprenticeship level:</strong> 4<br />
<strong>Approximate scheme length:</strong>	2 years<br />
<strong>Location:</strong>	London<br />
<strong>Salary:</strong> Starts from &pound;18,624<br />
<strong>Eligibility Criteria:</strong><br />
5 GCSE's A*-C (or equivalent) including maths and English language. Plus 2 A Levels A*-D (or equivalent). You are not eligible for this scheme if you currently hold or are working towards a qualification at the same or higher level in a related subject and content from the qualification of this scheme. You must be 18 years of age by 1st September of the year in which you apply, to be eligible for this scheme.</p>
<h3>What will I be doing?</h3>
<p>You'll work closely with experienced financial professionals to establish and maintain financial policies, manage key software packages (i.e. Microsoft Excel) and accounting systems (i.e. SAP), to ensure TfL receives all due income on time so the team can meet its financial targets. You'll learn to combine accounting and management skills in order to liaise effectively with your team, wider business teams and third parties, ensuring that budgets are accurate and robust, so that TfL can continue to deliver its world class service.</p>
<h3>What will the scheme involve?</h3>
<p>You will complete 4 six-month placements across the two year scheme. These may be in any of the following areas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Financial Shared Services - working in various finance disciplines such as cash management, revenue assurance and financial accounting.</li>
    <li>Operational placement in one of TfL operational businesses (e.g. London Buses, London River Services, Elizabeth line).</li>
    <li>Finance Business Partner - Embedding and supporting key operational business units such as the Elizabeth line, London Underground, Santander's Cycle and major projects.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What training and support will I get?</h3>
<p>For the duration of the scheme you'll have a finance sponsor who is responsible for the design and delivery of your training. They will help to secure the right placements for you and support you in your professional development. You'll also have a mentor that'll support and guide you, sharing their knowledge and expertise. Finally, you will have a buddy, who is either a previous apprentice or graduate from your scheme. Your buddy can answer any day to day questions you have and share their experiences with you.</p>
<p>During the scheme you'll not only complete the qualification but also have opportunities to complete additional training courses. These will vary from soft skills training to technical skills training. Your sponsors and placement managers will ensure you attend all the relevant training to support you in your role.</p>
<h3>What do we look for?</h3>
<p>You will be enthusiastic, self-motivated and logical, with a keen interest in mathematics and problem solving.  You will also be a strong communicator, as a key requirement for all finance professionals is to collaborate well with others, both in your team and the wider business.<br />
Management accountants play a vital role in managing business opportunities and using evidence to develop dynamic solutions. This information informs TfL's business strategy and helps to manage the future of the business. So demonstrating your potential and motivation to learn how to do this is really important.</p>
<h3>Where can this career take me?</h3>
<p>You'll gain a Level 4 CIMA certificate in Business Accounting and a Level 4 Diploma in Business Accounting Practice.  After completing these qualifications there could be the opportunity for business sponsorship to progress onto the full CIMA qualification, thus becoming a CGMA (Chartered Global Management Accountant).</p>
<p>On successful completion of the apprenticeship scheme you could become a finance officer, divisional accountant or assistant finance business partner role, with a career path into management and financial accounting and then more senior manager roles.</p>
