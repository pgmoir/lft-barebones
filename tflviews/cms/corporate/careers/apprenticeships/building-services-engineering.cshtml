<h2>About the role</h2>
<p>Building services engineering covers a range of areas, including: design, installation and commissioning. It also includes the maintenance of electrical and mechanical (E&amp;M) assets, like lighting, low voltage, lightning protection, domestic water, gas, heating, air conditioning, and ventilation sub-assets across the London Underground system. These assets can be found anywhere, from stations, line side equipment rooms and depots, to sidings, train crew accommodations, and line control centres. They are essential to the operation of the railway.</p>
<p>London Underground is currently upgrading parts of its network (Northern line extension, deep tube upgrade, Crossrail, etc.) which means that it's an an exciting time, and opportunity, for you to become an apprentice on one of the most technologically advanced and diverse railways in the world.</p>
<p>Although we still use legacy (the old style) assets, we're also introducing modern, cutting-edge technology into our stations and associated buildings. The principles and science behind old and new aren't very different, so you'll learn skills which apply to E&amp;M assets past and present. </p>
<h3>Placements</h3>
<p>You'll work on a number of placements during the scheme, all of which will give you a good overview of the building services engineering area. Our projects come in all sizes, so you could find yourself working on something small or something larger and more complex, like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Local infrastructure performance improvements, such as platform re-lighting, E&amp;M modifications within escalator machine rooms and lift equipment rooms</li>
    <li>Minor and major station refurbishments, ticket hall modernisations, platform modernisations or depot alterations </li>
    <li>Line upgrades </li>
</ul>
<p>During your placements, you could find yourself working on a range of projects, including: in-house design, or supervising the installation/commissioning of E&amp;M assets to make sure the asset base remains safe and operable. </p>
<h2>About you</h2>
<p>On this varied and challenging apprenticeship, you'll gain a Level 4 HNC qualification as a building services engineering technician, and become eligible for registration with an appropriate professional body, such as the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE), Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) and Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET). </p>
<p>You'll receive on-the-job learning from our professional and experienced building service engineers, project managers and commercial managers, as well as classroom training. Combined, we want you to develop the diverse knowledge and wide range of skills you'll need for a successful career in engineering.</p>
<p>Because this apprenticeship scheme is structured, you'll also gain:</p>
<ul>
    <li>First-hand experience of various renewal and enhancement activities across our stations and associated building portfolio</li>
    <li>An introduction to the building services engineering principles, specifications, standards, and contractual and commercial agreements that will help you support delivery of the renewal and enhancements activates</li>
</ul>
<p>Successfully completing this apprenticeship could lead to a position in one of our E&amp;M sub-teams. From there, you could have the opportunity to develop into one of our resident experts. This would involve continued professional development, including further academic learning.</p>
<p>Learn more about the benefits for all of our apprenticeships schemes, and find out exactly what we're looking for. </p>
If you're successful you'll have to pass pre-employment checks before joining. These will include reference checks, qualifications checks, right to work in the UK and in some cases a medical and a Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) check.
