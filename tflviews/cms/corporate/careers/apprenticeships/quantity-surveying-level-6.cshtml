      <p><strong>Apprenticeship level:</strong>		6<br />
<strong>Approximate scheme length:</strong>		5 years<br />
<strong>Salary:</strong> Starts from &pound;18,624	<br />
<strong>Eligibility criteria:</strong><br />
5 GCSE's A*-C (or equivalent) including maths and English language and 3 A level's (or equivalent)  A*-C in any subject. You are not eligible for this scheme if you currently hold or are working towards a qualification at the same or higher level in a related subject and content from the qualification of this scheme. You must be 18 years of age by 1st September of the year in which you apply, to be eligible for this scheme.</p>
<h3>What will I be doing?</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges our network faces is upgrading an infrastructure which dates back to 1863 whilst continuing to run an efficient service. As we look to modernise our assets, you'll be involved in improving our stations to enhance station capacity, improving the reliability of the network, reducing times between services and developing new entrances in stations to reduce congestion.</p>
<p>We seek to deliver a world class customer service so our modernisation plans also include working to improve wireless connections and improve the aesthetic appeal of our infrastructure.  Our plans extend across our network; easy to follow signage is vital to ensure our system is fully accessible to the population of London, bus prioritisation and creating additional road networks to reduce journey times to name a few focuses of the team.</p>
<h3>What will the programme involve?</h3>
<p>You'll start with four 6 month rotations. The rotations cover all parts of the business including London Underground, capital projects, operational improvement projects, maintenance of existing assets, refurbishment of existing assets, The DLR, London Trams, surface &amp; London Overground etc. In each of these business areas your role may involve:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Project Estimating</li>
    <li>Cost Control, Forecasting and reporting.</li>
    <li>Contracts and Contract Administration</li>
    <li>Procurement and Tendering</li>
    <li>Dispute Avoidance and Dispute Resolution</li>
</ul>
<h3>What do we look for?</h3>
<p>You'll enjoy working in a team, and should be happy to take on board the opinions of others with a strong eye for detail. During the apprenticeship you'll develop stakeholder management and negotiation skills as well as the ability to project manage. We're looking for proactive individuals with a strong passion for improving the lives of Londoners and the city we serve.</p>
<h3>What training and support will I get?</h3>
<p>For the duration of the scheme you'll have a business sponsor that is responsible for the design and delivery of the apprenticeship scheme. They will help secure the right placements for you and support you in your professional development. You'll also have a mentor that'll support and guide you sharing their knowledge and expertise. Finally you can expect to have a buddy, either a previous apprentice or graduate from this scheme. Your buddy can answer any day to day questions you have and share their experiences with you.</p>
<p>During the scheme you'll not only complete the qualification but also have opportunities to complete additional training courses. These will vary from soft skills training to technical skills training. Your sponsors and placement managers will ensure you attend all the relevant training to support you in your role.</p>
<h3>Where can this career take me?</h3>
<p>On completion of your Level 3 apprenticeship, you will continue your apprenticeship onto a Level 6 Higher Apprenticeship (approximately 3 years) , gaining a degree in quantity surveying along with full professional membership of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (MRICS).</p>
<p>On completing your apprenticeship, apprentices tend to become an assistant commercial manager/QS, commercial manager/QS senior commercial manager. The skills you develop during your apprenticeship are highly transferrable to specialisms including project management, dispute and dispute resolution professionals, forensic planning and cost analysis, contract administration and opening your own practice.</p>
<p>MRICS status is worldwide - not just UK based making this a truly international opportunity.</p>
