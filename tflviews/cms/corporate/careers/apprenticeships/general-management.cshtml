<strong>Approximate scheme length</strong>:	4 years<br />
<strong>Location</strong>:	London<br />
<strong>Salary:</strong> Starts from &pound;18,624<br />
<strong>Eligibility criteria:</strong><br />
5 GCSE's A*-C (or equivalent) including maths and English language. Plus 3 A Levels A*-C (or equivalent). You are not eligible for this scheme if you currently hold or are working towards a qualification at the same or higher level in a related subject and content from the qualification of this scheme. You must be 18 years of age by 1st September of the year in which you apply, to be eligible for this scheme.</p>
<h3>What will I be doing?</h3>
<p>You'll gain experience across a range of different projects from London Underground, surface transport and buses, to pedestrian and river boat services, providing opportunities for challenges, growth and development. You could find yourself working behind a desk gathering and analysing data that will guide multi-million pound investment decisions, or benchmarking TfL against other metros and bus operators from around the world, to see what we can learn from them and do better here.  Or you could be on the frontline, engaging with key business sponsors such as MPs or London Assembly members, to explain our proposals and answer their concerns, whilst managing with a team of staff and thousands of customer's everyday.</p>
<h3>What will the scheme involve?</h3>
<p>Placements on this apprenticeship are split into 8 six-month placements. You can expect to be predominantly office-based, although likely to be on transport operations for at least one your placements which will require shift work. Your responsibilities might include leading a team of staff at a busy Zone 1 Tube station to make sure that the morning peak or a big concert passes smoothly, preparing business cases and other crucial project documents, looking for ways to increase the commercial income we make from our network, or even working on a project to introduce exciting new technology that will transform our customers' experience.</p>
<h3>What training and support will I get?</h3>
<p>For the duration of the scheme you'll have a business sponsor that is responsible for the design and delivery of the apprenticeship scheme. They will help secure the right placements for you and support you in your professional development. You'll also have a mentor that'll support and guide you sharing their knowledge and expertise. Finally you can expect to have a buddy, either a previous apprentice or graduate from this scheme. Your buddy can answer any day to day questions you have and share their experiences with you.</p>
<p>During the scheme you'll not only complete the qualification but also have opportunities to complete additional training courses. These will vary from soft skills training to technical skills training. Your sponsors and placement managers will ensure you attend all the relevant training to support you in your role.</p>
<h3>What do we look for?</h3>
<p>You will be enthusiastic, self-motivated, adaptable and resilient. With strong abilities in problem-solving, you will be forward-thinking, able to challenge and be full of innovative ideas, which you will deliver. General management is all about working with people, so you'll be a strong communicator too, with an ability to build relationships easily and collaborate well with others.<br />
Where can this career take me?</p>
<p>On this new exciting and challenging apprenticeship you will broaden your understanding of management, experience the operational imperatives of the business and enhance the diversity of the management population across TfL that represents the city we serve.</p>
<p>You'll work towards achieving a degree in management and business (BA Hons) and a full chartered membership with Chartered Management Institute (CMI).</p>
<p>You will also receive professional development support to help you make the right next step for you upon successfully completing the scheme. Where possible, we will look to align this with your preferred placement experiences. This could include a role transport operations or in any of our core business functions.</p>
