<p><strong>Apprenticeship level:</strong>	4<br />
<strong>Scheme length:</strong>	4 Years<br />
<strong>Location:</strong>	London<br />
<strong>Salary:</strong> Starts from &pound;18,624<br />
<strong>Eligibility criteria:</strong> <br />
5 GCSE's A*-C including maths and English language plus 2 A Levels (A*-D) or equivalent  in any discipline. You are not eligible for this scheme if you currently hold or are working towards a qualification at the same or higher level in a related subject and content from the qualification of this scheme. You must be 18 years of age by 1st September of the year in which you apply to be eligible for this scheme.</p>
<h3>Job overview</h3>
<p>Railway systems performance is at the heart of our railway design. We use our understanding of the different systems that make up our railway, and their interactions, to create solutions that improve our railway's capacity, reliability and efficiency.</p>
<h3>What will I be doing?</h3>
<p>Following an induction into the role, including training in our bespoke modelling tool, the Railway Engineering Simulator (RES), you will follow a series of placements designed to give a broad knowledge of all the different types of railway assets, areas of the business, and our design processes. This will include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Train systems performance engineering</li>
    <li>Infrastructure systems performance engineering</li>
    <li>Modelling software development</li>
    <li>Signalling design</li>
    <li>Track design</li>
    <li>Train testing</li>
    <li>Maintenance engineering</li>
    <li>Research and development</li>
    <li>Computer aided design and 3D modelling</li>
    <li>Railway system reliability</li>
</ul>
<h3>What will the programme involve?</h3>
<p>You will work on real life projects, applying your knowledge to improve the performance of London Underground's railway. Your work will directly shape the future of our railway, leading to faster journey times, better energy efficiency and improvements to train service reliability.</p>
<p>We are experts at building computer models to simulate the behaviour of the various facets of the railway - so one of the rotations could be using these models to test out designs be it the performance of our new trains, the capability of the power network, or the capacity of the signalling systems.</p>
<h3>What do we look for?</h3>
<p>You will be highly motivated and proactive, with a passion for engineering. If you're a logical thinker with a strong ability to problem solve and tackle technical challenges then this scheme is the perfect way to kick start your career.</p>
<h3>Where can this career take me?</h3>
<p>At the end of the scheme, you'll have satisfied the requirements for professional registration, via the Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET), as engineering technician. On completion of the apprenticeship  there is a possibility of securing a technician engineer position, with further career progression opportunities available - such as assistant engineer, engineer, and engineering manager.<br />
The current Director of Engineering and Major Projects Director for TfL both started as a technician apprentices so it can be seen that the apprentices can aspire eventually to senior management positions.</p>
<h3>What training and support will I get?</h3>
<p>For the duration of the scheme you'll have a business sponsor that is responsible for the design and delivery of your apprenticeship scheme. They will help secure the right placements for you and support you in your professional development. You'll also have a mentor that will support and guide you by sharing their knowledge and expertise. Finally, you can expect to have a buddy, either a previous apprentice or graduate from this scheme. Your buddy can answer any day to day questions you have and share their experiences with you.</p>
<p>During the scheme you'll not only complete the qualification but also have opportunities to complete additional training courses. These will vary from soft skills training to technical skills training. Your sponsors and placement managers will ensure you attend all the relevant training to support you in your role.</p>
<h3>Contacting Us</h3>
<p>If at any time you need to speak to anyone within the recruitment team then please contact us Monday &#45; Friday between 08:30 and 17:30 on 0333 0062939 (Option 1) or alternatively email us at <a href="mailto:apprenticeshipenquiries&#64;tfljobs.co.uk">apprenticeshipenquiries&#64;tfljobs.co.uk</a>.</p>
