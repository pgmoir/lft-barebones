      <p><strong>Apprenticeship level</strong>:	6<br />
<strong>Approximate scheme length</strong>:	5 years<br />
<strong>Location:</strong>	London<br />
<strong>Salary:</strong> Starts from &pound;18,624<br />
<strong>Eligibility criteria:</strong><br />
5 GCSE's A*-C (or equivalent) including maths and English language. Plus 3 A Levels A*-C (or equivalent) in any subject. You are not eligible for this scheme if you currently hold or are working towards a qualification at the same or higher level in a related subject and content from the qualification of this scheme. You must be 18 years of age by 1st September of the year in which you apply to be eligible for this scheme.</p>
<h3>What will I be doing?</h3>
<p>Working with the Mayor of London, we will use our assets to create homes, jobs and growth across the capital. In your first year, you'll be working in property management then rotate through other property teams for the rest of the period with us.  During the course of your scheme you will be given a set of properties to manage and projects to run.</p>
<p>The apprenticeship scheme will mean you have the opportunity to spend around 6 months in each of our property departments, ranging from supporting tenants with day-to-day enquiries to helping to build new homes for Londoners.</p>
<h3>What will the scheme involve?</h3>
<p>During your first year in property management you'll develop an understanding of the legislative knowledge necessary to succeed in commercial property &#45; lease renewals, rent reviews, handling tenants, on the ground applications for refits, facilities and compliance.</p>
<p>Other rotations involve:</p>
<p>Operational Property &#45; In this team, you'll gain hands on experience of valuations and rates.</p>
<p>Commercial Revenue &#45; This involves developing projects, including identifying new retail space and letting this space. You'll meet external suppliers and retailers alongside assessing bids.  This also involves working with our project team, approving fit out designs to help the retailer get into TfL spaces.</p>
<p>Property Development &#45; This is key area of Commercial Development's growth, where you'll be involved in delivering new homes for Londoners.</p>
<p>Other&#45; You'll rotate  through strategy and customer and performance teams, providing an insight into the strategic approach we take, working on performance reporting and how we manage our customer base.  This will give you some key experience on scorecards, finance and strategy.</p>
<h3>What training and support will I get?</h3>
<p>For the duration of the scheme you'll have a business sponsor that is responsible for the design and delivery of the apprenticeship scheme. They will help secure the right placements for you and support you in your professional development. You'll also have a mentor that'll support and guide you sharing their knowledge and expertise. Finally you can expect to have a buddy, either a previous apprentice or graduate from this scheme. Your buddy can answer any day to day questions you have and share their experiences with you.</p>
<p>During the scheme you'll not only complete the qualification but also have opportunities to complete additional training courses. These will vary from soft skills training to technical skills training. Your sponsors and placement managers will ensure you attend all the relevant training to support you in your role.</p>
<h3>What do we look for?</h3>
<p>You'll be enthusiastic and willing to learn new things, with the ability to work well with others and independently. Given the wide variety of people and teams you're interacting with you'll  have great communication skills and a strong eye for detail.</p>
<h3>Where can this career take me?</h3>
<p>This is an excellent route into the property industry and you will be supported as you complete your RICS APS qualifications.  On completion of  the scheme, many take the commercial route into being a property surveyor. This scheme can lead to roles in property development and commercial revenue, using base experience as a surveyor in management or operational property, to then move into asset work.</p>
