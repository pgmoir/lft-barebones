      <p><strong>Apprenticeship level:</strong>	3<br />
<strong>Approximate scheme length:</strong>	2 years<br />
<strong>Location:</strong>	London<br />
<strong>Salary</strong>:	Starts from &pound;18,624<br />
<strong>Eligibility criteria</strong>:<br />
5 GCSE's A*-C including maths and English language or equivalent. You are not eligible for this scheme if you currently hold or are working towards a Level 4, 5, 6, 7, HND/C or degree qualification. You are not eligible for this scheme if you currently hold or are working towards a qualification at the same or higher level in a related subject and content from the qualification of this scheme. You must be 16 years of age by 1st September of the year in which you apply, to be eligible for this scheme.</p>
<h3>What will I be doing?</h3>
<p>During the programme, you'll rotate through different teams. As an example, one of your placements might be in our project and programme sponsorship directorate; here you'll get the chance to see highway improvement projects through from conception to delivery. Overseeing the design and implementation process, you will be able to take direct responsibility for a range of improvements to London's red route network, including schemes which aim to improve road safety, make journey times more reliable, improve walking and cycling conditions to improve public health and air quality, or improve bus journeys for millions of Londoners each year. Working with a team of highly skilled planners, you will get to play a key role in shaping London's travel behaviour and keeping the city moving even though unprecedented growth.</p>
<p>Of course, we offer a variety of placements, each of which comes with its own challenges and rewards.</p>
<h3>What will the programme involve?</h3>
<p>As a transport planning apprentice, you will undertake four six-month placements in various teams across TfL's city planning and surface transport directorates.</p>
<p>Placements cover a wide range of transport planning functions, which could include handling design and implementation of road network improvements; using computer models to analyse and forecast demand; working on developing London's flagship bus network; influencing behaviour change and encouraging a shift towards sustainable transport modes; assessing planned developments and roadworks on London's roads - to name but a few!</p>
<h3>What training and support will I get?</h3>
<p>For the duration of the scheme you'll have a business sponsor that is responsible for the design and delivery of the apprenticeship scheme. They will help secure the right placements for you and support you in your professional development. You'll also have a mentor that'll support and guide you sharing their knowledge and expertise. Finally, you can expect to have a buddy, either a previous apprentice from this scheme or a graduate from a similar programme. Your buddy can answer any day to day questions you have and share their experiences with you.</p>
<p>During the scheme, you'll not only complete a BTEC Level 3 in Transport Planning, but also have opportunities to complete additional training courses. These will vary from 'soft skills' training to specialist technical training. Your sponsors and placement managers will ensure you attend all the relevant training to support you in your role.</p>
<h3>What do we look for?</h3>
<p>You'll have an inquisitive mind and a creative approach to problem-solving.<br />
You'll be interested in and committed to improving travel conditions for all of London's road users, and enthusiastic about delivering change.</p>
<p>If you are excited about how London is changing, whilst thinking strategically about improvements in our great city, then this is the career path for you.</p>
<p>We'll be looking to know what makes you passionate about the profession.</p>
<h3>Where can this career take me?</h3>
<p>An apprenticeship in transport planning could lead to a career in the field, whether with TfL or in either the public or private sectors anywhere in the world. Outside this area, the programme could lead to roles in town / urban planning, partner communications, or project management, amongst others. Completion of this apprenticeship will fulfil the requirements for membership of the Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation (CIHT).</p>
