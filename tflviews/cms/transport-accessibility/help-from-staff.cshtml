      <p>We have staff at all Tube, TfL Rail&nbsp;and Overground stations whenever services are running. Some piers, all boats, the Emirates Air Line and Victoria Coach Station are staffed.</p>

<p>Trams and buses are staffed by the driver and the DLR has&nbsp;Passenger Service Agents on trains.</p>

<h2>Booking assistance</h2>

<p>You do not have to pre-book assistance to use some of our services, as we operate a turn-up-and-go service on London Underground, London Overground and at some TfL Rail stations*.</p>

<p>However, you are welcome to book in advance on the Overground and TfL Rail as part of the national Passenger Assist service. If you would like to pre-book assistance you should do so at least 24 hours in advance by calling 0343 222 2000 (<a href="/corporate/terms-and-conditions/tfl-call-charges">TfL call charges</a>). This helpline is open between 08:00-20:00 Mon - Sun (excluding Christmas Day). You can also book online on the <a href="https://passenger-assist.org/assisttravel/TravelAssist.aspx?LAYOUT=BLANK&amp;TOCCode=DLkP6_p3jo9SUbFl9cJ_ZQ==">Passenger Assist website</a>.</p>

<p>If you need help accessing the DLR, visit the DLR website to contact our <a href="/modes/dlr/dlr-ambassadors">Community Ambassadors</a> for advice.</p>

<p>* Please note that not all stations are staffed when services are running. Call 0343 222 1234 (<a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/terms-and-conditions/tfl-call-charges">TfL call charges</a>) to find out more.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How to find staff</h2>

<p>On the Tube, TfL Rail and Overground, station staff are encouraged to offer help to anyone who looks as though they might need assistance. If you can't immediately see a staff member, they can usually be found in the ticket hall or gateline, or on platforms at busier times.</p>

<p>On the DLR and trams, most stops and stations are unstaffed, but you can find a staff member on the train. Staff are easy to find at the coach station, Emirates Air Line terminals and on piers and boats.</p>

<p>Help points can be found throughout our networks. You can use them to contact staff for information and assistance or in an emergency. Many have induction loops to work with hearing aids.</p>

<h2>What to expect from staff</h2>

<p>On buses, the driver can kneel the bus if you need it lowered, put out the wheelchair ramp and encourage passengers to clear the wheelchair space if you need it. Drivers should also make sure passengers have time to hold on or sit down before moving away. Please ask them if you need any information or help.</p>

            If you have mobility impairments and have trouble using public transport, you may be able to get subsidised taxi and minicab travel in London. The two schemes are called Taxicard and Capital Call.

    </div>
   <p>
On
our rail networks, piers and boats, staff can give advice, information and assistance. If you
need help planning a route or buying a ticket, please ask.
</p>
<p>If you need assistance or to use taxi features such as the intermediate step or swivel seat, just ask the driver.</p>
<h2>
Assistance to and from trains
</h2>
<p>On the Tube, TfL Rail and Overground, station staff will accompany you to the train and help you on board and, if needed, can arrange for you to be met at your destination. If the station has manual boarding ramps to provide level access, staff will deploy these. Staff may not be able to provide assistance with heavy luggage or carrying buggies.</p>
<p>Anyone can use this service, but it is particularly used by blind and visually impaired passengers and people
using boarding ramps
onto trains.
</p>
<p>If
you would like to use this service, ask a member of staff when you arrive at
the station.</p>
<p>
If
you aren't sure whether you will need to use a boarding ramp at any point on
your journey, use the <a href="/transport-accessibility/wheelchair-access-and-avoiding-stairs">step-free Tube guide</a> or
look out for the messages in <a href="/plan-a-journey/index">Journey Planner</a>.
</p>
<h2>Travel support card
</h2>
<p>We
produce a travel support card to help people
communicate any assistance or information requirements they have with staff. You can use it on any of our services.
</p>
<p>There
is space on the card to write down what assistance or information you need.
</p>
<p><a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/forms/12387.aspx?cid=accessguides">Order your Travel Support card here</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can download and print your own copies:</p>
