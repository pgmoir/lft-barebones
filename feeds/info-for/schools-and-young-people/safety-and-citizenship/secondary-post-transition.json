     "These sessions are delivered to secondary schools pupils. The sessions explore ways in which journeys have changed for young people since their transition to independent travel from primary school. Post-transition in-school presentations are allocated after referral from local policing teams, TfL and members of staff at the school. We concentrate on schools where pupils have experienced specific travel concerns.",

     "Presentations last between 20 minutes and an hour to fit in with secondary timetabling. Longer time slots allow a more interactive and comprehensive session. We see whole year groups together where possible.",
     "Sessions are tailored to the individual audience. We respond directly to issues, ideas and queries from pupils. We enter into a non-confrontational dialogue with young people, promoting honest responses and an open forum. Pupils use this to explore and resolve issues they may have experienced on the transport network.",
     "Sessions include fast-paced, educational videos, images to support learning points, role play and question and answer. All videos are age-appropriate and fully subtitled.",
     "Pupils find the presentations engaging and enjoyable and they appreciate the chance to express their opinions.",
     "Topics covered might include:",
