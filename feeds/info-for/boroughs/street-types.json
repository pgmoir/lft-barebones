     "The \u003ca href=\"/corporate/publications-and-reports/roads-task-force\"\u003eRoads Task Force\u003c/a\u003e was set up in 2012 to consider how to tackle the challenges facing London's roads. It recommended that London's 34 traffic authorities use a new 'street family' as a practical way to understand the mixed use of our roads.",
     "We started using the Street Types method to categorise streets in September 2014.",
     "The process uses a series of workshops to consider the 'movement' and 'place' functions of each road separately. These are then combined and each road is classified according to nine street types and represented on a final map.",
     "Instead of describing the quality of a road, the final map illustrates common agreement on its current function. The map also helps decision makers understand the amount of change needed when planning for the future and can be refined as roads evolve and new data are published.",

     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Using Street Types\"}",
     "The aim of Street Types is to help planners understand how a street is used and the movement through it. They can then work together to make sure customers get a consistent level of service on TfL and borough roads, whether they are travelling by foot, bicycle, bus or car.",
     "More than 21 million trips take place on the Capital's road network each day so it's important that we, the boroughs and other interested groups work together to plan how travel may change in the future.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Background\"}",
     "The development of Street Types involved more than 400 experts from TfL, the GLA and London's boroughs. By working together we were able to classify all roads in London, not just those for which we have data.",
     "The work recognises what role the street network plays in civic life and highlights where areas are under pressure to keep people moving."
