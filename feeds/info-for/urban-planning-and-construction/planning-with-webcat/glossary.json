     "\u003cstrong\u003eAccess Index (AI):\u003c/strong\u003e This index is one of the stages in calculating PTAL values. An Access Index value is calculated for each transport service that the PTAL value is composed of (combining walk time and service wait time). The total Access Index for all services is used to derive the PTAL.",
     "The full calculation method is described in our \u003ca href=\"/info-for/urban-planning-and-construction/planning-applications/planning-with-webcat#connectivity\"\u003econnectivity assessment guide\u003c/a\u003e .",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eAccessibility:\u003c/strong\u003e This term has been used in the past in two distinct ways - its definition often depends on the accompanying text or context. 'Accessibility' of the transport system often refers to the extent to which the transport system is suitable for people with a range of needs (for example, people with prams and wheelchair users). It may also be used to describe more generally how good the level of transport provision is in different areas.",
     "This has led to some confusion over the use of the term and that is why WebCAT refers to 'connectivity' to differentiate itself from issues related to physical accessibility.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eAM Peak:\u003c/strong\u003e Three-hour morning peak time period from 07:00 to 10:00",

     "\u003cstrong\u003eBase year:\u003c/strong\u003e The base year refers to the public transport network closest to the current state. It is used as a consistent benchmark to compare the current situation with the future network. In WebCAT the PTAL base year is 2015, TIM public transport base year is 2011 and the Cycling base tear is 2014.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eBetween Peak Times:\u003c/strong\u003e Six-hour time period between the peak periods from 10:00 to 16:00. This time period is also known as the Inter-Peak.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eCatchment:\u003c/strong\u003e In WebCAT, a catchment area contains all the places that can be reached within a specified travel time from a specified place. WebCAT allows the calculation of the population, number of workplaces or various services within catchment areas associated with the scenario chosen.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eCensus Output Areas (COAs):\u003c/strong\u003e Created for the output of census estimates. A COA is the lowest geographical level at which census estimates are provided and align to the census zoning hierarchy. Greater London is split into 25,053 zones.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eConnectivity:\u003c/strong\u003e In WebCAT the term 'connectivity' is used instead of the more widely used term of 'accessibility' because that usually refers to the physical access to the network. Connectivity describes the ease with which travel is possible from one area to another using measures such as the travel time. WebCAT provides multiple measures of connectivity.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eDirection:\u003c/strong\u003e WebCAT allows you to select the direction of travel. This can be TO the point-of-interest or FROM the point-of-interest. The default value used in WebCAT is an AVERAGE of the two.",

This is derived from the GLA's 2013 round of population forecasts which have been split between TfL's transport model zoning system. WebCAT includes data for the years 2011, 2021 and 2031.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eEmployment data:\u003c/strong\u003e Employment data sets are based on the GLA's 2013 round of employment forecasts which have been split between TfL's transport model zoning system.",
     "The 2013 round of employment forecasts cover a series of five year periods from 2011 to 2041. WebCAT includes data for the years 2011, 2021 and 2031. No breakdown by employment sector is provided in WebCAT.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eEquivalent doorstep frequency (EDF):\u003c/strong\u003e PTAL calculation term - the EDF is derived from the Total Access Time and converts the time to a frequency value.",

     "\u003cstrong\u003eForecast years:\u003c/strong\u003e Forecast years refer to transport networks and other data sets that have been estimated for the future. Within WebCAT we have forecast outputs for 2021 and 2031. Forecasts are just that - an estimate of what will occur in the future. In WebCAT the forecast public transport networks we use only include funded and committed transport schemes.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eFrequency:\u003c/strong\u003e The number of public transport services per hour on a specific route. Frequency is used in the PTAL to calculate the service wait time.",

     "\u003cstrong\u003eLower Super Output Areas (LSOAs):\u003c/strong\u003e Aggregations of groups of COAs that are used to report census statistics. Like COAs, they align to the census zoning hierarchy. There are 4,835 LSOAs in London.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eMajor centres:\u003c/strong\u003e One of the London Town Centre categories defined in the London Plan. These are typically found in inner and some parts of outer London with a borough-wide catchment. They generally contain over 50,000sq m of retail floor space with a relatively high proportion of comparison goods relative to convenience goods. They may also have significant employment, leisure, service and civic functions.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eMetropolitan centres:\u003c/strong\u003e One of the London Town Centre categories defined in the London Plan. These serve wide catchments which can extend over several boroughs and into parts of the wider South East region.

The GLA forecasts cover a series of five year periods from 2011 to 2041. WebCAT includes results for 2011, 2021 and 2041. The 2011 data set is derived from the 2011 census.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003ePM  Peak:\u003c/strong\u003e Three hour evening peak travel time period from 16:00 to 19:00",
     "\u003cstrong\u003ePopulation Pensionable Age:\u003c/strong\u003e This data allows for future increases to the state pension age.

     "\u003cstrong\u003ePTAL:\u003c/strong\u003e Public Transport Access Level is a measure of access to the public transport network. For any given point in London, PTALs combine walk times from a chosen point to the network (stations and bus stops, for example) together with service frequency data at these locations. This provides an overall access index which can be allocated to nine accessibility levels between 0 and 6b. In WebCAT, PTAL values have been pre-calculated for a grid of points covering the whole of London (approximately 150,000 point).",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eScenario:\u003c/strong\u003e A representation of the public transport network including definitions of modes, routes, and frequencies for a specific year and time period.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eStandard Waiting Time (SWT):\u003c/strong\u003e PTAL calculation term, SWT is measured in minutes. It combines average service waiting time (half the time interval between arrivals of services at a stop) + the mode based reliability factor.",

     "\u003cstrong\u003eStep-free:\u003c/strong\u003e This term usually refers to the physical nature of the network. Where a step-free network is cited this indicates that a full public transport network has been modified to include only those links where step-free access is possible specifically within stations. In WebCAT, step-free is defined as a separate mode.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eTIM:\u003c/strong\u003e Travel Time Mapping - a complementary measure of connectivity to PTALs in WebCAT. Travel times in TIM use travel time data derived from TfL's transport models. The models divide London into over 3200 statistical areas or zones, providing times for all possible origin and destination zone combinations - equivalent to over 9 million records for each scenario. This means the user can select any location within London and WebCAT can quickly display travel times based on the zone where the selected point is located.",
