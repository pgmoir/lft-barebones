This includes stopping on zigzag lines (for example, by pedestrian crossings or on school crossings) or where there is a 'No stopping' sign\",\"Private hire vehicles must never stop on taxi ranks, even when picking up or setting down customers\",\"If there are waiting or parking restrictions, drivers cannot stop for longer than necessary for the customer to get in or out of the vehicle. The exception is that between 22:00 and 06:00 drivers can stop for up to five minutes on red routes to allow customers to use cash points\",\"Where waiting or parking restrictions apply, there is no general exemption to leave the vehicle to assist a customer to or from a building. A driver who feels this assistance is essential should minimise any time spent away from the vehicle and, if possible, record details of the customer in case a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN) is issued\",\"When not picking up or dropping off, a driver waiting at a time and place where restrictions apply will be liable to receive a PCN. This applies even if the vehicle has arrived early for a booking or the customer is late, or where a customer asks a driver to stop and wait while they visit a shop or use a cashpoint\",\"Taxi and private hire drivers should not leave their engines idling.

On red routes both taxis and private hire vehicles cannot stop at bus stops marked with a wide red line by the kerb. At other red route bus stops, taxi and private hire drivers should avoid stopping to avoid disruption to the bus network\",\"Remember, only licensed taxi drivers can drive in bus lanes - private hire vehicles are not allowed.
