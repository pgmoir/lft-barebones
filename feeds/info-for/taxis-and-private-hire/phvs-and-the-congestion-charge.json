     "Following a public consultation, changes have been made to the Congestion Charge scheme to ensure it remains effective in reducing the use of cars in central London.",
     "Since 8 April 2019, private hire vehicles entering the Congestion Charge zone between 07:00 and 18:00, Monday to Friday, will need to pay the £11.50 daily charge. See our \u003ca href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge\"\u003eCongestion Charge\u003c/a\u003e page for more information about the charge and how to pay.",
     "Private hire vehicles that are designated as \u003ca href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/taxis-and-private-hire/passengers-and-accessibility\"\u003ewheelchair-accessible vehicles (WAVs)\u003c/a\u003e will retain the exemption, but only when carrying out a private hire booking for a TfL-licensed private hire operator.",
     "PHVs are designated as WAVs at the point of the vehicle licensing inspection and this is noted on the vehicle licence.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Cleaner vehicle discount\"}",
     "A new, phased cleaner vehicle discount was introduced on 8 April 2019, replacing the existing Ultra Low Emission Discount.",
     "The first phase of the discount will mean only certain zero-emission capable vehicles are exempt from the Congestion Charge. To qualify, a private hire vehicle must be Euro 6, emit no more than 75g/km of CO2 and have a minimum zero-emission capable range of 20 miles. Restrictions on the discount will tighten in October 2021 to support the Mayor's ambition for zero-emission road transport by 2050. - only pure electric vehicles will qualify. The discount will be withdrawn in December 2025.",
     "See more about the cleaner vehicle discount and other discounts that a private hire vehicle might be eligible for on the \u003ca href=\"http://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge/discounts-and-exemptions\"\u003eDiscounts and exemptions page\u003c/a\u003e .",

     "Taxis (black cabs) will remain exempt from paying the Congestion Charge when actively licensed with London Taxi and Private Hire. A vehicle will be removed from the register of exempt vehicles on the surrender, expiry or revocation of the license.",
     "Further measures aimed at improving air quality in the capital include a restructuring of the taxi delicensing scheme, with £18m available for taxi drivers who delicense their vehicles. For further information, \u003ca href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/taxis-and-private-hire/emissions-standards-for-taxis\"\u003evisit our web page\u003c/a\u003e about emissions standards for taxis. Top payments of £10,000 are available to the first 1250 applicants, with tiered payment levels available at significantly higher levels than the current scheme.",
     "We will also offer a limited number of Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) conversion grants to drivers of Euro 5 taxis to support the shift of those vehicles with worst NOx emissions to cleaner vehicles.",
     "Further details on the new delicensing scheme and LPG grants will be announced early next year.",
     "We also intend to consult on proposals to reduce taxi emissions further, including a proposal of phased reductions of the taxi age limit for the dirtiest vehicles to 12 years. The 15 year age limit would be strictly mandated in 2019, with a proposed reduction in the age limit each year until a 12 year age limit is reached.",
     "The age limit for Euro 6, LPG and Zero-Emission Capable taxis is proposed to remain at 15 years.",
     "The consultation will launch early next year."
