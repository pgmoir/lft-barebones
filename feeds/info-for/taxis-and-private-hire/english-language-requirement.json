     "It is essential for public safety that all licensed private hire drivers are able to communicate in English at an appropriate level. Drivers need to be able to communicate with passengers to discuss a route or fare, as well as read, understand and respond to important regulatory, safety and travel information sent by TfL.",
     "Previously, we stated that any application for a new or renewal private hire driver's licence that was received on or after 14 October 2016 had until 30 April 2019 to provide evidence that they comply with the English language requirement.",

After listening to the private hire industry we are also giving further consideration to reviewing the way we assess an applicant's English language skills.",
     "No further action is needed by anyone who has submitted satisfactory evidence that they comply with the ELR, unless TfL contacts them to request anything further. If a licensee or applicant has not yet provided evidence, they now have until 30 September 2020 to do so.",
