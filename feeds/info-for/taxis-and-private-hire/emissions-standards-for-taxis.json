     "Tackling pollution in London is a public health priority. To combat poor air quality, innovative and bold measures are being taken to ensure the health and wellbeing of all road users. Historically, the taxi trade has had a limited choice of diesel vehicles to use. This has led to the fleet becoming a significant contributor to poor air quality, particularly in central London, where they contribute 16% of all transport Nitrous Oxide (NOx) in central London.",

The age limit for Euro 6, LPG and ZEC taxis is proposed to remain at 15 years.",
