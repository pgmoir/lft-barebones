Private hire vehicles designated as wheelchair-accessible by TfL will be exempt from the charge until 26 October 2025.",
     "All other PHVs need to meet exhaust emissions standards (ULEZ standards) or pay an additional daily charge when travelling within central London.",
     "You will need to consider these emissions standards ahead of driving in to the zone and should check if your vehicle will meet the standards to help you plan ahead.",
