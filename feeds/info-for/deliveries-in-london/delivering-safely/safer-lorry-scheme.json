     "One of the Mayor and TfL's top priorities is to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured on London's roads by 40% by 2020 and action is being taken to prioritise the safety of the most vulnerable road users: pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists.",
     "At present, heavy goods vehicles (HGVs/lorries) are involved in a disproportionate number of fatal collisions involving cyclists and pedestrians. In 2013, HGVs were involved in 9 out of 14 incidents leading to cyclist fatalities.",
     "Following a request from the Mayor, a feasibility study was conducted to consider the various ways of improving lorry safety in London. Based on its recommendations, TfL and London Councils held a six-week consultation over summer 2014 into their plans to introduce the Safer Lorry Scheme.",
     "TfL reviewed all of the feedback provided and wrote a consultation report. The report sets out the findings of the consultation in full, with 90%of respondents supporting the plans.",
     "After considering the feedback from the consultation, TfL, together with London Councils and Heathrow Airport, decided to progress the proposal. A statutory consultation on the Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) required for the scheme took place in November 2014."
