     "\"This money will help to make daily journeys more convenient and pleasant whether by public transport, in a car, on foot or by bike.",
     "\"By supporting transport spending in the boroughs over the past six years we have improved town centres, increased cycling by 72 per cent and approved more than 1000 travel plans to get children to and from school safely.\"",
     "London's Transport Commissioner Peter Hendy said: \"This money will go directly towards improving transport for people in Greenwich.",
     "\"We will fund a combination of both large and small projects and by working in partnership with each borough we know that local communities will see a difference.",
