     "Bexley's allocation is part of a record £160m of funding announced for boroughs across the Capital.",
     "Since the Mayor was first elected in 2000, funding for boroughs has almost doubled - this year's allocation shows a 92 per cent increase from 1999/2000.",
     "It is part of the record-breaking five year £792m programme for local transport schemes included in Transport for London's (TfL's) £10bn Investment Programme, and is an increase on the £765m previously announced.",
     "Mayor of London Ken Livingstone said: \"People in Bexley are benefiting from Transport for London funding, which is providing real, local travel improvements.",
     "\"All parts of our city, from the suburbs to the centre, are supported directly through this transport investment.",
     "\"This money will help to make daily journeys more convenient and pleasant whether by public transport, in a car, on foot or by bike.",
     "\"By supporting transport spending in the boroughs over the past six years we have improved town centres, increased cycling by 72 per cent and approved more than 1000 travel plans to get children to and from school safely.\"",
     "London's Transport Commissioner Peter Hendy said: \"This money will go directly towards improving transport for people in Bexley.",
     "\"We will fund a combination of both large and small projects and by working in partnership with each borough we know that local communities will see a difference.",
     "\"This funding is an important part of our wider programme of spending in all boroughs to improve public transport and make walking and cycling journeys easier and safer.\"",
