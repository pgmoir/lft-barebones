     "This includes improved town centres, better access to stations, road renewal \nschemes, road safety projects, and schemes to reduce pollution though increased \nwalking and cycling.",
     "Since the Mayor was first elected in 2000, funding for boroughs has almost \ndoubled - this year's allocation shows a 92 per cent increase from 1999/2000.",
     "It is part of the record-breaking five-year £792m programme for local \ntransport schemes included in Transport for London's £10bn Investment Programme, \nand is an increase on the £765m previously announced.",
     "Mayor of London Ken Livingstone said: \"People in boroughs across London, both \ninner and outer, are benefiting from Transport for London funding, which is \nproviding real, local travel improvements.",
     "\"All parts of our city, from the suburbs to the centre, are supported \ndirectly through this transport investment.",
     "\"This money will help to make millions of daily journeys more convenient and \npleasant whether by public transport, in a car, on foot, or by bike.",
     "\"By supporting transport spending in the boroughs over the past six years we \nhave improved town centres, increased cycling by 72 per cent and approved more \nthan 1000 travel plans to get children to and from school safely.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Easier journeys\"}",
     "\"I am pleased to hear that London Councils has withdrawn its ill-thought out \nplan to cut funding for organisations campaigning for sustainable transport, \nwhich relieves me of the need to divert some of the funding announced today to \nsupport those organisations' valuable work.",
     "\"This u-turn will be welcomed by those who are concerned about climate \nchange.\"",
     "London's Transport Commissioner Peter Hendy said: \"This money will go \ndirectly towards improving transport for people in every borough in London.",
     "\"We will fund a combination of both large and small projects and by working \nin partnership with each borough we know that local communities will see a \ndifference.",
     "\"Borough funding is an important part of our wider programme of spending in \nall boroughs to improve public transport and make walking and cycling journeys \neasier and safer.\"",
