     "People living, working, visiting and travelling in Haringey will benefit from a range of projects delivered by the council during 2007/08.",
     "These include improved town centres, better access to stations, road renewal schemes, road safety projects, and schemes to reduce pollution through increased walking and cycling.",
     "Haringey's allocation is part of a record £160m of funding announced for boroughs across the Capital.",
     "Since the Mayor was first elected in 2000, funding for boroughs has almost doubled - this year's allocation shows a 92 per cent increase from 1999/2000.",
     "It is part of the record-breaking five year £792m programme for local transport schemes included in Transport for London's (TfL's)£10bn Investment Programme, and is an increase on the £765m previously announced.",
     "Mayor of London Ken Livingstone said: \"We are committed to making transport in Haringey cleaner, safer and green and this announcement of £4.1 for transport improvements for Haringey will make a real difference.",
     "\"Haringey is benefiting from a number of new transport initiatives including the first hybrid buses in London being introduced on the 141 route and a new scheme to give personalised travel advice to Haringey residents in Alexandra, Crouch End, Fortis Green, Highgate, Hornsey, Muswell Hill and Stroud Green.",
     "\"All parts of our city, from the suburbs to the centre, are supported directly through this transport investment.",
     "\"This money will help to make daily journeys more convenient and pleasant whether by public transport, in a car, on foot or by bike.",
     "\"By supporting transport spending in the boroughs over the past six years we have improved town centres, increased cycling by 72 per cent and approved more than 1000 travel plans to get children to and from school safely.\"",
     "London's Transport Commissioner Peter Hendy said: \"This money will go directly towards improving transport for people in Haringey.",
     "\"We will fund a combination of both large and small projects and by working in partnership with each borough we know that local communities will see a difference.",
     "\"This funding is an important part of our wider programme of spending in all boroughs to improve public transport and make walking and cycling journeys easier and safer.\"",
