     "This includes improved town centres, better access to stations road renewal schemes, road safety projects, and schemes to reduce pollution through increased walking and cycling.",

     "It is part of the record-breaking five-year £792m programme for local transport schemes included in Transport for London's (TfL's) £10bn Investment Programme, and is an increase on the £765m previously announced.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMayor of London Ken Livingstone said: \"People in Ealing are benefiting from Transport for London funding, which is providing real, local travel improvements.",

     "\"This money will help to make millions of daily journeys more convenient and pleasant whether in a car, on foot, on a bus or by bike.",
     "\"By supporting transport spending in the boroughs over the past six years we have improved town centres, increased cycling by 72 per cent and approved more than 1000 travel plans to get children to and from school safely.",
     "\"I strongly encourage Ealing to continue discussions with TfL on the issue of the bus lanes in Northolt which currently at risk of suspension by the council.",
     "\"If a satisfactory conclusion cannot be reached on this, or any other proposed bus lane withdrawals in Ealing, then TfL may need to consider withdrawing funding in the borough.\"",

The same applies to reviews elsewhere in Ealing, for example in Southall.",
     "\"I welcome recent engagement and the prospect of new bus priority schemes elsewhere in Ealing but I must underline that as for all boroughs, Ealing Council must use today's allocation to support the delivery of the Mayor's Transport Strategy and assist TfL in delivering safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services within London\"\u003cbr /\u003e",
