     "LU busker Duncan Kane has been chosen amongst many talented musicians to perform for 1,700 celebrities and awards attendees as they leave the Odeon in Leicester Square to make their way to a diner and drinks reception at Grosvenor House.",
     "Duncan Kane remarked: \"I am absolutely chuffed to be playing for such a star studded audience. As a London Underground busker, I am used to performing for very large crowds on a daily basis but this will definitely be a night to remember.",
     "\"I will be performing my favourite film theme songs such as Mrs Robinson from the Graduate, Everybody's Talkin' from Midnight Cowboy and Stuck In The Middle With You from Reservoir Dogs.\"",
     "Duncan Kane has been a licensed Underground busker since the scheme, sponsored by Carling, started in May 2003.",
     "Steve Charlick, LU Operations Manager, said: \"The London Underground busking scheme sponsored by Carling is going from strength to strength since it started in May 2003.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Underground sounds\"}",
     "\"The Underground represents a unique platform for artists to showcase their talent in front of millions of passengers each week.",
     "\"The fact that a London Underground busker has been asked to perform at the Orange British Academy Film Awards demonstrates how talented many of them are. Duncan is a fantastic musician and I know that BAFTA awards-goers will enjoy his music as much as we do.\"",
     "Clare Brown, BAFTA Head of Production, said: \"At the Orange British Academy Film Awards we are always looking for ways to enhance the evening.",
     "\"We wanted to entertain our 1,700 VIPs as they got on to their transport and thought it would be fun to bring a touch of London street culture to the event by hiring an Underground busker to serenade them.",
     "\"After listening to a shortlist of performers we selected Duncan Kane because of his strong voice and wide-ranging film music repertoire.\"",
