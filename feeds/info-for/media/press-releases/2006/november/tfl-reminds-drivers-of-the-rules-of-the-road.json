     "'Know the Rules' is part of the overall strategy to reduce congestion on \nLondon's roads, and it has been shown that drivers following these regulations \nhave a significant impact on traffic flow.",
     "TfL's Head of Traffic Enforcement, Patrick Troy, said: \"All drivers should be \naware of these road regulations from the Highway Code, but this campaign aims to \nact as a reminder.",
     "\"These regulations are crucial to traffic flow which impacts on all road \nusers - the more drivers follow the rules, the more safe and reliable the roads \nwill be.",
     "\"We have already seen real improvements on some roads in London which has \nmeant average bus speeds have gone up and journey times have gone down.",
     "\"Compliance with the rules ultimately saves everyone a lot of time and \nmoney.\"",
     "Councillor Daniel Moylan, Executive Member for Transport and Environment for \nLondon Councils, which is co-sponsoring the campaign, said: \"Transport in the \nCapital can be a highly emotive issue. Local councils play a key role in helping \nto keep London moving through the proper enforcement of traffic offences.",
     "\"However, part of that role is a duty to ensure our local communities are \nfully aware of what constitutes a traffic offence - particularly with regards to \nred routes and yellow boxes.",

     "\"Through better awareness of these rules we hope to reduce the number of \ntraffic offences in the Capital and make roads safer across London.\"",
