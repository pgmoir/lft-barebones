     "The Safer Transport at Night project - a partnership between the \nMayor of London, Transport for London (TfL) and the Metropolitan Police - has \nbeen awarded the 14th annual Goldstein Award for Problem Orientated Policing for \n2006.",
     "The award, which receives entries from a number of countries around the \nworld, is given to a project that best reflects excellence in problem-orientated \npolicing.",
     "Since the campaign started in 2002, sexual assaults in illegal minicabs have \nfallen from an average of 18 a month to 10 a month currently. There has been a \nreduction in the usage of illegal cabs by women from 19 per cent in September \n2003 to four per cent in February 2006.",
     "The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, said: \"The Safer Travel at Night \ncampaign has successfully bought together key agencies to tackle the issue of \nillegal minicabs in London.",
     "\"Sexual attacks by minicab touts have fallen as a result of our work to \nlicense the minicab trade, as well as warning the public of the dangers of \ntaking these illegal cabs, and by providing alternative late night travel \nchoices.",
     "\"This award is welcome recognition, but we will not let up in our work to \nstamp out assaults.\"",
     "Steve Burton, TfL's deputy director of Transport Policing and Enforcement, \nsaid: \"To win this international award is testament to the dedication of all \nthree agencies involved in the Safer Travel at Night initiative, which is an \nongoing campaign.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Public awareness\"}",
     "\"This is the first time an application led by a non-policing organisation has \nwon this award so it is something we are very proud of as our commitment to the \nsafety of both our staff and passengers is our top priority.",
     "\"This issue of illegal taxi touts is one we take extremely seriously, and as \nwell as undertaking regular night time operations in London, we have carried out \nhigh profile marketing campaigns warning Londoners, particularly young women, of \nthe dangers of getting into an illegal minicab.\"",
     "Chief Superintendent Michael Humphrey, Transport Operational Command Unit, \nsaid: \"Safer Travel at Night helps raise public awareness about the dangers of \ntaxi touts who undermine the legitimate private hire vehicle trade.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\"I \nwould advise everyone not to get into any vehicle that they have not booked \nthrough a reputable licensed company. I congratulate TfL on their achievement in \nleading this initiative recognised by the Goldstein award.\"",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Marshalled ranks\"}",
     "TfL's entry was based on the Safer Travel at Night project partnership.",
     "The project's successes include the 'Know what you're getting into' public \nawareness campaign, more night buses than ever before, the licensing of all \nminicabs vehicles and operators, making taxi touting a recordable offence, \nmarshalled taxi ranks and, by the end of 2005, all buses in the Capital were \nfitted with CCTV.",
     "In addition, the Transport Operational Command Unit - a dedicated Police unit \nset up to target crime relating to bus services and minicab activities - \nundertakes policing operations to target minicab touts.",
