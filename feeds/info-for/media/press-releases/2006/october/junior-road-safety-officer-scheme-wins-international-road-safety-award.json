     "Transport for London's (TfL's) Junior Road Safety Officer (JRSO) scheme will be presented with a prestigious Prince Michael of Kent International Road Safety Award today, during a special JRSO event in Kingston Guildhall.",
     "Designed for nine to 11-year-olds, the JRSO scheme recruits one or two children in each participating school to act as road safety champions and lead on promoting road safety issues amongst their peers, through initiatives such as games, competitions and special assemblies.",
     "It aims to give the children a good grounding in road safety education as they prepare to make the transition to secondary school - the point at which many children begin to travel independently for the first time.",
     "The scheme is playing an important role in reducing the numbers of children killed or seriously injured on London's roads, which has fallen by 62 per cent from an average of 935 a year in the mid to late 1990s to 355 in 2005.",
     "Prince Michael Road Safety Awards are presented to individuals, companies or organisations in recognition of their outstanding contribution to improving road safety.",

     "Also congratulating the winners, Adrian Walsh, Director of the Prince Michael International Road Safety Awards, said: \"There is little doubt that empowering children is a really effective way of increasing awareness and raising standards in the community.",
     "\"The commitment of these young people is outstanding and the London JRSOs have set a really high standard which should be copied across the country.\"",
     "Janet Kirrage, London Road Safety Education Manager at TfL, said: \"The first year of the TfL Junior Road Safety Officer scheme got a brilliant response from schools across London. This initiative, led by children for children, is playing a vital role in the work TfL is doing to reduce child road casualty figures in London - which have fallen by 62 per cent since the mid to late 1990s.",
     "\"While there is still a long way to go, we are delighted that the JRSO project has been recognised with this Prince Michael International Road Safety Award, and we look forward to the schemes continued growth and success over the next few years.\"",
