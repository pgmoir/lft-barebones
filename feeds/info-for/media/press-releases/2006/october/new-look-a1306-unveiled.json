     "These included the regeneration site where the road was formerly blighted by \na high wall down the middle segregating the north and south carriageways, which \nhad prevented pedestrian access and separated the communities north and south of \nthe road.",
     "The A1306 project, costing £8.68m, began in 1999, with the civil engineering \nworks for the final phase completed this summer.",
     "Following the 'de-trunking' of the A1306 between Goresbrook Interchange in \nBarking \u0026 Dagenham and Dovers Corner in Havering in 2000, the two boroughs \ntook on responsibility for the road's maintenance and, through partnerships with \nLondon Riverside Limited and the Cleanaway Riverside Trust, have sought to \nenhance the appearance of the road and improve accessibility to the local \ncommunity.",
     "Work along the stretch of road has included:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"The removal of the carriageway's central wall\",\"The removal of subways and a footbridge and replaced with accessible \\npedestrian crossing facilities\",\"The implementation of bus priority measures with new bus lanes and improved \\nbus stops\",\"The installation of safety cameras\",\"The installation of new street signs and lamp columns\",\"An extensive programme of soft landscaping including the planting of shrubs \\nand over 200 trees along the route\"]}",
     "The road now provides a more suitable environment for the existing \nresidential communities to the north and the new homes proposed to the \nsouth.",
     "Funding for the scheme came from a variety of partners, with TfL providing \n£4.62m through TfL Borough Spending Plans, £3.04m from the London Riverside \nTrust (through London Development Agency SRB funding), and £0.452m from the \nLondon Borough of Havering.",
     "A further £0.154m was contributed by the Department for Transport (DfT) and \n£0.409m from private investment.",
     "TfL's Director of Communications Ben Plowden said: \"This project is a really \ngood example of Transport for London working in partnership with the boroughs \nand other local organisations to make the local environment safer, more \naccessible and more attractive.",
     "\"I'm delighted that Transport for London has been able to support this \nproject which will help the borough's plans to regenerate the area.\"",

     "Councillor Peter Gardner, Havering's Lead Member for Public Safety \nresponsible for Strategic Transport, said: \"The A1306 paves the way for the \nsignificant regeneration planned to the west of Rainham.",
     "\"The new traffic measurements and environmental improvements have markedly \nimproved the public transport accessibility and the public realm of the \narea.\"",
     "Councillor Sid Kallar, Barking \u0026 Dagenham's Executive Member for \nRegeneration, said: \"The quality of the work undertaken in developing the A1306 \nand enhancing its immediate environment is indicative of the quality of the \npartnership that the boroughs have formed with TfL and other partners.",
     "\"The road has certainly come a long way since de-trunking began six years ago \nand it is satisfying to see these works now complete.\"",
     "In addition to the completed de-trunking and regeneration project, TfL's \nBorough Spending Plan 'Streets for People' programme is funding the pilot of a \nsolar-powered irrigation scheme in the A1306 Havering area, with water being \ntaken from underground boreh",
