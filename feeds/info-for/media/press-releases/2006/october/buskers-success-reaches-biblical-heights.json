     "Soprano and Underground musician Angelina Kalahari accompanied by fellow busker and guitarist Richard Stevenson will perform alongside Reading University Piano Professor Elizabeth Dockrell-Tyler.",
     "Angelina said: \"Performing at St James's Church, such an eminent and popular venue is really a dream come true.",
     "\"It will be an experience we will cherish forever. World famous musicians such as classical Guitarist John Williams have performed there so it is truly an honour for us.\"",
     "The concert, entitled An Evening of Enchanting Classics by the trio Timeless, will feature masterpieces such as Puccini's O mio babbino caro; Debussy's Claire de Lune and Rodrigo's En Aranjuez don tu amor.",
     "Steve Charlick, LU Technical Specialist Manager who heads the LU busking scheme, remarked: \"We are really proud of Angelina and Richard's achievement.",
     "\"They have both been with us since the London Underground busking scheme started in 2003.",
     "\"Their fantastic success demonstrates that thanks to the audition process we have put in place the quality of the music we offer passengers on the Underground is at an all time high and we have witnessed several similar success stories.",
     "\"I am looking forward to attending this concert which I know will be unforgettable.\"",
     "The gifted trio will perform using a nine foot Bosendorfer piano; one of only two such pianos for public use in London.",
