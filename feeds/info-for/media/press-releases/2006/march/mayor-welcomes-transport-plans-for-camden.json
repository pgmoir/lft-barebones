     "Camden Council was one of the first boroughs to submit a Local Implementation Plan (LIP) to the Mayor outlining its vision for local transport improvements across the area.",

     "The GLA Act 1999 requires each London borough to prepare a LIP showing how it proposes to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy.",
     "Mayor of London Ken Livingstone said: \"The London boroughs play a key role in the successful delivery of my transport strategy which focuses on bringing safer, more accessible and more sustainable transport right across the capital. I am happy to approve Camden's plan.\"",

This will mean that one in ten trips by Camden residents will be made by bicycle\",\"Camden's Clear Zones programme and Travel Awareness campaigns - these will aim to significantly cut pollution in central London and promote the health and physical fitness of Londoners\"]}",

     "\"We are keen to work in partnership with Transport for London (TfL) to ensure that the aims and objectives of the plan are fully implemented.",
     "\"These include making sure that our roads remain safe and that we continue to reduce congestion and pollution in our borough through further environmentally friendly transport schemes.",
