     "The digital technology incorporated in the Smart car will improve the efficiency and accuracy of enforcement",
     "The Smart car will mark the first introduction of digital technology that will eventually replace the existing analogue systems which Transport for London (TfL) currently uses to enforce parking violations on the TLRN.",
     "The Smart car is part of a Digital Traffic Enforcement System (DTES) which has been developed by TfL and its contractors.",
     "It is equipped with  automatic number plate recognition cameras, enhanced Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and DVD recording.*",
     "In the future the vehicle's existing functionality will be further enhanced through the use of banking encryption standards, wireless transmission and high speed broadband connectivity.",
     "Patrick Troy, TfL's Head of Traffic Enforcement, said: \"The digital technology incorporated in the Smart car will improve the efficiency and accuracy of enforcement as well as act as a further deterrent to those who are thinking about contravening parking regulations on the Transport for London Road Network.",
     "\"Just one driver blocking a red route or a bus route can cause major congestion and delays for other drivers.",
     "\"The message is simple for the benefit of all drivers, please observe the rules of the road when you drive so that London's traffic can keep moving for everybody.",
     "\"The aim of enforcement is to keep London's buses and other traffic moving quickly and reliably around London.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Flexibility and innnovation\"}",
     "\"Since enforcement of the TLRN, buses are now 15 per cent faster in bus lanes than in normal traffic lanes and between January 2003 to November 2005 compliance has seen a significant improvement with the number of PCNs per lane reduced by 85 per cent.\"",
     "Jim Lewis, TfL's Project Manager for DTES, said:\"This was a pioneering project, which has thrust traffic enforcement into the digital age by fusing a number of technologies together for the first time.",
     "\"The development of the new system has demanded strong teamwork, flexibility and innovation from all those involved over the past three years and we're confident that where Transport for London has led, others will soon follow.\"\u003cbr /\u003e",
