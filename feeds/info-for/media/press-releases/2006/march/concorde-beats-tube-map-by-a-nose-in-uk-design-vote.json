     "Its brilliance is reflected in the fact that it has influenced metro system maps all over the world",
     "Viewers of BBC Two's The Culture Show and visitors to London's \nDesign Museum were asked to choose from 25 design icons including the \nRoutemaster bus, the London A-Z map and the red telephone box as part of the \nGreat British Design Quest.",
     "Mayor of London Ken Livingstone said: \"Harry Beck's original design for the \nLondon Tube has become a design classic, genuinely loved and appreciated by \nLondoners and flexible enough to adapt to the changing face of the Tube over the \nyears.",
     "\"The Tube map is simple and modern, giving a form and structure to the Tube \nsystem and even much of London itself.",
     "\"The Tube map has made navigating the oldest underground network in the world \nstraightforward and its brilliance is reflected in the fact that it has \ninfluenced metro system maps all over the world.",
     "\"Over the next few years the map will be updated once again with the addition \nof the extension to the East London Line and other transport improvements, \nshowing the flexibility of Harry Beck's original vision.\"",
     "Fifteen million copies of the London Underground map are printed and \ndistributed each year.",
     "The original map and drawings are held by London's Transport Museum, \ncurrently closed for re-development.",
     "The new Museum, opening in spring 2007, will showcase the rich design \nheritage of London's transport - including the Underground's roundel logo, \nunique Johnston typeface and unique poster collection.",
     "The Tube map was the brainchild of Underground electrical draughtsman, Harry \nBeck, who produced the imaginative yet stunningly simple design back in 1931 \nwhen the Tube grew so large it became impossible to map the lines and stations \ngeographically. The first Harry Beck map was issued in 1933.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Stunningly simple\"}",
     "Beck based his map on the circuit diagrams he drew for his day job, stripping \nthe sprawling Tube network down to basics.",
     "The result was an instantly clear and comprehensible chart that would become \nan essential guide to London - and a template for transport maps the world \nover.",
     "At first, London Transport was reluctant to adopt the idea, which was based \non a diagrammatic rather than the conventional geographical format.",
     "However, the concept was eagerly accepted by the travelling public.",
     "Beck's revolutionary design, with certain modification and additions, \nsurvives to the present day and is set to serve London Underground and its three \nmillion passengers each day for many years to come."
