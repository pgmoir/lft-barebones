     "#EndEditableLondon Buses has invested over half a million pounds since last summer, in addition to £1 million invested in the previous year, to continue the job of making the Capital's buses more comfortable in warm summer weather.",
     "This investment means that nearly 2,300 out of the 4,900-strong double deck fleet now have additional upper deck opening windows and hundreds of other double deckers have also been fitted with either forced air ventilation systems or air cooling systems.",
     "Peter Hendy said: 'Almost half of our double decker buses have already been fitted with extra opening windows on the top deck to help deal with the high temperatures that we sometimes encounter during the summer months.",
     "'The high-density city centre routes, which tend to heat up the most, have been our priority, but I can confirm today that the remainder of the fleet will be similarly equipped by summer next year.'",
     "All new buses entering service must have heat reflective white painted roof panels, body insulation, more opening windows on the upper deck, tinted glass and heaters which switch off automatically when the bus gets too warm.",
     "In addition, a programme has begun to refurbish buses that have been in service for more than five years, which will include converting older manual heating systems to the automatic type and painting roof panels white.",
