     "The significant improvements in bus services have been sustained, air quality \nis better with the most harmful vehicle emissions down by 13-15 per cent, \ncycling levels are up 43 per cent, and independent research demonstrates that \nroad safety has improved with up to 70 fewer personal road injuries per year as \na direct result of Congestion Charging.",
     "Reductions in congestion were slightly lower in 2005 than in previous years.",
     "The average reduction since the scheme began is 26 per cent.",
     "This is well above the Mayor's initial target of a 20 per cent reduction in \ncongestion, and it reflects changes in road space allocation to improve road \nsafety and assist pedestrians, cyclists and buses, which are demonstrably \nachieving additional benefits of importance to London.",
     "However this reduction needs to be measured in the context of the long-term \ntrend of increasing congestion across London.",
     "Measured against this overall background trend, congestion within the zone is \ndown 30 per cent.",
     "Mayor of London Ken Livingstone said: \"This report shows that the Congestion \nCharge continues to be highly effective in decreasing congestion in the Capital.",
     "\"Traffic levels and associated carbon emissions have been cut, bus services \nhave improved, the roads are safer, and London's air quality has improved thanks \nto reduced vehicle emissions.",

     "\"Cities from across the world can look to our scheme as a benchmark for how \nto tackle the economic and social problems associated with congestion.\"",
     "Michele Dix, Director of Congestion Charging, said: \"Three years on from the \nstart of the scheme and London is a nicer place to work, live and visit.",
     "\"Traffic levels are down, more people are walking and cycling, the number of \npeople using buses is up thanks to a quicker and far more reliable service and \ncongestion has been cut.",
     "\"The key aim of the Congestion Charge is to reduce levels of traffic coming \ninto central London which is something we continue to see.",
     "\"The Capital is the only major city in the world to achieve a shift from \nprivate car use to public transport, delivered through the combination of \nCongestion Charging and the expansion of the bus service.\"",
