     "Hosted by popular children's TV celebrities Anna Williamson and \nJeff Brazier, Street Safe Live saw the fictional cartoon characters from TfL's \nJRSO packs brought to life on stage, and included the announcement of the Street \nSafe Live Road Safety Award winners for 2006, a road safety quiz, and a fashion \nparade.",
     "The show ran in tandem with a stakeholder event at the same venue, where Road \nSafety Officers from the London boroughs and officials from across London were \ninvited to find out what TfL is doing to make London's roads safer, and to \nencourage more schools and boroughs to introduce Street Safe Live.",
     "The scheme is already operating in around 200 schools in 18 London \nboroughs.",
     "Mayor of London Ken Livingstone said: \"We have seen a dramatic fall in the \nnumber of children killed or seriously injured on London's roads in the past six \nyears, thanks to improvements to the capital's roads, greater measures to deter \nspeeding motorists, increased investment and award winning campaigns such as \n'don't die before you've lived'.",
     "\"But one young life lost on London's roads is one too many. Junior Road \nSafety Officers in schools across London are playing a vital role in helping us \nremind young people about road safety.",
     "\"Congratulations and a big thank you to all our road safety officers for \ntheir excellent work.\"",
     "Jenny Jones, the Mayor's road safety ambassador, said: \"We have to make our \nroads so safe that parents will allow their children to walk and cycle to \nschool.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Safer roads\"}",
     "\"We not only want fewer deaths and injuries on London's roads, we also want \nchildren, pedestrians and cyclists to feel safe and confident when using them. \nLondon has successfully invested in educating drivers, children and cyclists \nabout road safety and London has more than doubled investment in 20mph zones \naround schools and putting in safety measures demanded by parents.\"",
     "Christine Fitzgerald, Road Safety Officer at TfL, said: \"More than 550 Year \nFive and Six students from around 200 of London's schools have worked incredibly \nhard during the JRSO scheme's first year to promote road safety within their \nschools.",
     "\"JRSOs and their peers have produced a remarkable variety of road safety \nprojects since September, from a road safety website, to summer holiday safety \nleaflets, to a JRSO speaking to their MP when visiting the House of Commons \nabout a petition for a pedestrian crossing.\"",
     "Shane Kirton, Junior Road Safety Officer at St Mary's CoE Primary School in \nWalthamstow, said: \"The best thing about being a JRSO is teaching other children \nabout safety on the roads, especially the younger children who need more \nhelp.\"",
