     "\"Bus lanes offer benefits not only to bus passengers, who enjoy improved reliability of service, but also to cyclists, a quarter of whom - according to DfT sponsored research - choose their route according to the availability of bus lanes.",

     "\"Ealing Council is due to receive Â£4.6m for 2006/7 from Transport for London for local transport measures.",
