     "Compliance with bus lane restrictions has also dramatically improved with an 85 per cent reduction in the number of Penalty Charge Notices (PCNs) issued per bus lane.",
     "There has also been an increase in the numbers of cyclists using bus lanes. For example, the number of cyclists traveling southbound on the Holloway Road in peak evening time has increased by 80 per cent.",
     "Mayor of London Ken Livingstone said: 'These are remarkable figures showing a dramatic improvement in the speed and reliability of many bus services in London and a recognition by all drivers that they all benefit from a well managed road network.'",
     "Patrick Troy, TfL's Head of Traffic Enforcement, said: 'Enforcement of bus lanes, along with an extensive public information campaign, has resulted in a real change in driver behaviour, improved compliance and directly related improvements to the transport network.'\u003cbr /\u003e"
