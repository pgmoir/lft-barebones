     "The LU Station Energy Challenge is an annual competition which awards the Tube station that managed to save the most energy with a special trophy.",
     "Energy saving methods such as turning off lights and escalators in engineering hours has allowed LU to dramatically reduce energy consumption.",
     "Rob Lawford, Morden Group Station Manager, said: \"This is a tremendous achievement for South Wimbledon station.",
     "\"Reducing the amount of energy that London Underground uses each year is not only cost effective, but also reduces the Tube's impact on climate change.\"",
     "During this year's Energy Challenge, stations managed to reduce energy consumption during the year compared to five years ago by 25.5 per cent, beating a target of 20 per cent.",
     "The cost of leaving one platform fluorescent light on constantly every year is £56.",
     "Platforms normally have about 50 fluorescent lights so the cost is £2,800 per year.",
     "The amount of electricity used by an escalator varies depending on how long it is and how far it rises but as a guide will cost in the region of between £7,000 and £12,000 each year.",
     "The efforts of stations to cut their energy use can have a dramatic impact on the total amount of energy LU uses each year.",
     "A new LU Station Energy Challenge started in the first week of April. Stations are being asked to reduce energy consumption by 22.5 per cent by the end of the 2006/7 financial year compared to the position five years previously.",
