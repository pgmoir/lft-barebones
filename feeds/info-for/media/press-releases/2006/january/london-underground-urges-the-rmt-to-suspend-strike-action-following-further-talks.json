     "London Underground (LU) met the RMT on Friday evening, 6 January to discuss their outstanding concerns.",
     "Mike Brown, LU Chief Operating Officer, said: \"A year ago a deal was reached which was hailed by both sides. London Underground is sticking to that agreement.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\"This strike is completely unnecessary. This deal gives Tube station staff a 35-hour working week and 52 days' holiday a year.",
     "\"It was agreed by the RMT over a year ago and hailed by them as groundbreaking. When put to a vote their members backed it 30-to-one.",
     "\"The new staff rosters have been agreed at 90 per cent of stations.",
     "\"There will be no job losses and no compromise on safety.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\"We met with the RMT informally last night and remain ready to do so again at any time. We made clear that we remain committed to our agreement and we aim to implement the 35-hour working week with 52 days' leave for all station staff on February 5 this year.",
     "\"This leaves plenty of time to resolve any outstanding issues without the need for industrial action. We call on the RMT to suspend their industrial action and continue discussions.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\"All this strike will do is disrupt Londoners to one degree or another and lose those who take part another day's pay. It will not alter our commitment to proceed with an agreement reach with the RMT and other trade unions morescriptthan a year ago.\"",
     "If the proposed RMT strike goes ahead it will affect services from 1830 on Sunday evening and all day Monday.",
     "As on New Year's Eve, LU would again seek to run the best service possible on these days.",
     "Passengers are advised to plan their journeys in advance and check this website for the latest news.",
