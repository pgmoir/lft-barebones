     "Pay-Next-Day would allow drivers to pay an £8 congestion charge until midnight on the day or to pay £10 until midnight on the following charging day.",
     "Mayor of London Ken Livingstone said: \"We are giving drivers an extra day to pay the Congestion Charge, allowing an additional day's grace for those people who have forgotten to pay on the day. This will start three months earlier than planned.\"",

     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Changes to the operation of the Congestion Charging scheme, such as allowing drivers to pay-next-day, require a variation order. Other proposed changes in this variation order include:\\u003cbr /\\u003e- To incentivise residents in the western extension to the Congestion Charging zone to register for their 90 per cent discounts in time for the introduction of the extension, they will be able to drive into the existing Central London zone at the discounted rate as soon as they are registered. They will be able to begin registering from October this year. The extension comes into force in February 2007\\u003cbr /\\u003e- Waiving the £10 fee for Blue Badge holders registering for their 100 per cent discounts (to encourage early registration).\",\"Extending the existing zone will bring considerable benefits. Congestion in the extended zone will be cut by 15-20 per cent. There will be 10-14 per cent less traffic within the zone during charging hours meaning that a vehicle making a journey into and back out of the extended zone would typically save five minutes\\u003cbr /\\u003e\"]}"
