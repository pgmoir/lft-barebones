     "Transport for London has agreed to pay for Oyster validation equipment to be \nprovided for all London rail stations in Zones 1 - 6.",
     "It is a significant breakthrough that offers train companies the opportunity \nto accept Oyster pay-as-you go products on their services.",

     "These are currently under development for use on public transport across the \ncountry by the Integrated Ticketing Smartcard Organisation (ITSO).",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Smart ticketing technology\"}",
     "This is a further step towards the wider introduction of smart ticketing \ntechnology outside of London.",
     "It will allow the development of fully integrated ticketing systems in and \nbeyond the Capital, extending the convenience and ease of smartcard technology \nto millions more passengers.",
     "It builds on the Government's decision to require bidders for the new South \nWestern rail franchise to set out how a new smart ticketing system could be \nintroduced across its franchise area from London to the South Coast.",
     "Announcing the deal, Douglas Alexander the new Transport Secretary said: \n\"This is a major step forward in ensuring that all passengers can benefit from \nthe improvements new technology can bring.",

     "The Mayor for London Ken Livingstone said: \"The extension of Oyster from just \nsixty rail stations to over three hundred under this agreement marks a massive \nstep towards a fully integrated ticketing system in London, enabling passengers \nto move easily between rail, Tube, DLR, tram and bus using an Oyster card and \nwithout having to buy separate tickets.",
     "\"It will deliver a real improvement to the journeys of thousands of Londoners \nwho currently cannot take advantage of the benefits of Oyster.",
     "\"This agreement between myself, the Secretary of State and Transport for \nLondon means Oyster card technology will be installed at National Rail stations, \nensuring that passengers will now be able to take full advantage of Oyster, \nwhich can be topped-up conveniently, offers cheaper fares and speeds up \njourneys.\"",
     "Peter Hendy, Transport for London Commissioner, said: \"This plan will bring \nLondon's transport network one step closer to being properly integrated, as \nTransport for London's services have been for several years.",
     "\"It resolves the problem passengers currently face of having to buy two \nseparate tickets to travel on overground rail and Transport for London services. \nThis is an unprecedented opportunity to extend the convenience of Oyster to \nthousands more Londoners.\"",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Pay-as-you-go\"}",
