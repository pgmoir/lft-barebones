     "The upgrade of the Waterloo \u0026 City line is part of Transport for London's (TfL's) £10bn Investment Programme to meet London's transport needs now and in the future.",
     "It will deliver faster journey times, more passenger capacity and a more reliable service.",
     "Tube passengers will also benefit from newly refurbished trains painted in the Underground's distinctive red, white and blue livery.",
     "CCTV cameras have been installed in all carriages to improve passenger safety and security.",
     "The upgrade has been an extremely complex project within a challenging timescale.",
     "London Underground has been demanding of Metronet, requiring the delivery of a great deal of work and improvements in a short space of time.",
     "This has largely been achieved in one of the most constrained parts of the network, with delivery a few days behind schedule after a five month closure.",
     "During the five-month closure, the track between Waterloo and Bank has been completely replaced and electrical and communications equipment renewed.",
     "London Underground Service Director Howard Collins said: \"We're investing billions to improve the Tube and the Waterloo \u0026 City is the latest example of this major investment.",
     "\"The upgrade and improvement works have now been completed by Metronet and final testing and staff training is underway.",
     "\"We look forward to a safer, more reliable and comfortable Waterloo \u0026 City line and for Metronet to continue to deliver improvements to the Tube, as promised.\"",
