     "On Saturday 13 August, 2016, Bromley Bus Garage will open its doors to members of the public.  This is the third of this year's bus garage open days across the Capital.  They have become a regular feature following similar events staged in 2014 and 2015.",
     "Visitors to the garage which is run by the bus operator, Stagecoach, will be able to enjoy:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"A display of vintage buses\",\"Local free rides on parts of routes 227 and 61 in historic buses\",\"A variety of stalls for bus enthusiasts\",\"Displays by the police and local schools and family activities organised by the London Transport Museum\"]}",
     "The day marks the centenary of the first journeys on bus route 109, which later became the 227 and still runs today through Beckenham and Bromley.  It was also a day in mid-August in 1986 when the first buses began operating under the new route tendering system and a fleet of maroon and grey midi-buses took to the streets under the new brand 'Roundabout'.",
     "All proceeds generated from programme sales at the event (£3 each) will be donated to Guide Dogs.",
     "In 2014, TfL held a number of bus garage open days as part of celebrations to mark the Year of the Bus, in partnership with London Transport Museum and the Capital's bus operators.",
     "This was part of a programme of events and activities which were held throughout 2014 to celebrate the role that London buses, bus drivers and the staff who support them play in keeping the Capital moving, and mark a number of important anniversaries.  Based on the success of these, further garage open days took place during 2015.",
     "Other London bus garages which will open their doors this year are Twickenham Garage (Abellio London) on Saturday 17 September and Stockwell Garage (Go-Ahead London) on Saturday 15 October.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eNotes for Editors:\u003c/strong\u003e ",
     "Bromley Bus Garage is served by the following bus routes: 61, 261, 336 and 358.",
