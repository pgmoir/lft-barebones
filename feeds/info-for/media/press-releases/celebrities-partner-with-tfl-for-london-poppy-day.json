     "'This year marks 100 years since the end of World War One and we will never forget the sacrifices made by our servicemen and women. We are committed to supporting the armed forces and their families as well as maintaining our relationship with The Royal British Legion. This has only been made possible due to the support of bus operators, station staff and our celebrity friends and we hope that Londoners give generously to this wonderful cause.'",
     "Director of Fundraising at The Royal British Legion, Claire Rowcliffe, said:",
     "'The Poppy Appeal target for 2018 is £50 million which is our biggest target ever and London Poppy Day is a huge part of that. We are aiming to raise £1 million on the day across the city and we are so grateful to Transport for London for their continual support as well as the hundreds of serving personnel who'll be collecting on behalf of The Legion.",
     "'In this centenary, the work of the Legion is as relevant and vital today as it was in the aftermath of the First World War when the charity was founded. The donation for your poppy will help the Legion support today's Armed Forces community through hardships, injury and bereavements. Generations of the Armed Forces have continued to serve and sacrifice since the First World War, and we recognise and thank them all for their contribution.'",

Santander also allowed the use of their branding space on the front basket of the Santander cycles.\",\"Since November 2008, war veterans have been able to travel on the Tube, DLR, Overground, TfL, National Rail services within London, London buses and Trams for free with a Veterans Oyster Photocard as part of the Mayor's voluntary concessionary travel scheme.\",\"Ex-service personnel looking to make the transition into civilian employment are encouraged to apply to roles at TfL.\",\"TfL has been running military industry days with suppliers, such as Siemens, alongside its employability programme, for ex-service personnel. The technical expertise and skills that they have developed during their military service, such as problem-solving, leadership, teamwork and working under pressure, are ideal for a number of roles within the transport industry. Many of those leaving the services might not realise that they have transferable skills or may be nervous because they haven't written a CV or undertaken an interview in a very long time. That's why on TfL's website there are tips and guidance too, to help overcome any potential barriers to success. TfL also offers those leaving the Forces the opportunity to undertake taster days and work placements, some of which result in permanent jobs.
