     "The new lifts have replaced nearly 30 year old lifts that were failing regularly and causing disruption to customers. While this work has been taking place, TfL has taken the opportunity to install new ticket gates to reduce congestion at busy times. Lighting has also been replaced and the ticket hall and passageways have been repainted, creating a more welcoming environment.",
     "Mark Wild, Managing Director of London Underground, said:",
     "'I would like to thank customers and local businesses for their patience throughout the lift replacement work, which we have carried out as swiftly as possible. The re-opening of the station with more reliable new lifts will improve transport connections in the area, benefitting local people, businesses and visitors alike.'",
     "Closing the station in July 2016 allowed the work to be completed as quickly and efficiently as possible, more than halving the time it would have taken to install the lifts had the station remained open during the refurbishment.",
     "Ben Stephenson, Chief Executive of WeAreWaterloo Business Improvement District, said:",
     "'We have been working with TfL to try to ensure the lift replacement works at Lambeth North are completed as soon as possible.  We are very glad to see these works completed on schedule and would urge everyone to support the many local businesses in the area. They will be very pleased to see you!'",
     "The improvements made to the station will also improve visitor access to local attractions.",
     "A spokesperson for the Imperial War Museum London said:",
     "'We welcome the re-opening of Lambeth North following essential upgrades at the station. The re-opening of Lambeth North is well-timed, as IWM welcomes visitors to mark its Centenary in early March.'",
     "Notes to Editors:",
