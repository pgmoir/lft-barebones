     "Transport for London (TfL) has successfully prosecuted energy company London Power Networks, a subsidiary of UK Power Networks, as part of its commitment to ensure roadworks cause the minimum disruption as possible to road users.",
     "London Power Networks' offences, including two counts of carrying out work without a permit and a further two counts of failing to serve the required statutory streetworks notices before beginning work, follow schemes undertaken in Bressenden Place and Lower Grosvenor Place on 9 February.",
     "Appearing before Westminster Magistrates' Court on 7 September, London Power Networks pleaded guilty to the offences and the company was fined £10,000 for each offence of working without a permit, the highest level ever imposed in London to date for a single streetworks offence. For failing to serve statutory streetworks notices the company was fined a total of £4,000, which resulted in an overall fine of £24,000. They were also ordered to pay £3,722 in prosecution costs.",
     "In passing sentence, the Judge said: \"I have seen a number of these cases and I remain unclear why large organisations such as London Power Networks continue to undermine regulations put in place to reduce inconvenience to road users when conducting streetworks. There is no acceptable excuse in my view and I hope the sentence passed today reflects that.\"",
     "Garrett Emmerson, TfL's Chief Operating Officer for Surface Transport, said:",
     "'Not providing these notices impacts on our ability to successfully coordinate streetworks and we will continue to push for the toughest penalties possible for utility companies caught acting unlawfully. We are committed to keeping London's roads as clear as possible preventing unnecessary traffic build up, which disrupts people's daily commute and worsens air quality.'",
     "TfL has prosecuted London Power Networks for five previous offences since 2014 and issued over 1,650 Fixed Penalty Notices, 167 of which within the last year.",
     "Including this latest offence, the company has been ordered to pay a total of £37,000 in fines for mismanaging streetworks since 2014.",
