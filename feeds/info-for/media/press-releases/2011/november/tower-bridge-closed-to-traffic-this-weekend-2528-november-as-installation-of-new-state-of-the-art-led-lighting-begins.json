     "This will include detailed inspections of the condition of the carriageway, as well as CCTV surveys of the drainage on the bridge and approaches.",
     "This work was originally planned to take place during the Christmas period but by rescheduling it to coincide with these works, fewer road closures will be required.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eA further bridge closure is planned for the weekend of 16-19 December to remove scaffolding.",
     "During this closure TfL will take the opportunity to begin the carriageway resurfacing works on the Tower Bridge Road originally planned to take place next year, as well as encourage utility companies to take advantage of the road closure to carry out any planned works.",
