Stretching from Shoreditch to the Olympic Stadium, the Mayor wants to transform Tech City into one of the world's great technology centres. Qualcomm is one of hundreds of companies to now be located there\",\"Part of the Source London network, 'fast charge' EV  points can halve the time required to fully charge from empty an electric vehicle with a 32 amp charge. Using a 'standard charge' EV point this can take up to eight hours but is reduced to up to four hours with a fast charger depending on the make of the electric vehicle. Exact charge times will vary according to the type of vehicle\",\"Currently electric vehicles that are available in the UK market cannot utilise fast charging. However including 'fast charge' points now future proofs the network and prepares London's charging infrastructure for the next generation of EVs vehicles due into the UK market next year which will be able to use them. The posts that host the 'fast charge' sockets are double-headed and also have a standard socket so that they can be used by all kinds of EV\",\"There are 233, installed Source London charge points across London\",\"Source London already has a range of public and private sector partners that are introducing charge points which includes: Asda, Capital Shopping Centres, Enterprise, Gatwick Airport, Heathrow Airport, Hertz, Ikea, NCP, Nissan, Old Ford Housing Association, Sainsbury's, Scottish and Southern Energy, Southern Railway, the Whittington NHS Trust, Q-Parks and 15 London boroughs\",\"There are currently 288 vehicles registered to the Source London scheme. To boost this even further annual membership will now cost only £10. This will give members the advantage of being able charge at any of the Source London charge points throughout London.
