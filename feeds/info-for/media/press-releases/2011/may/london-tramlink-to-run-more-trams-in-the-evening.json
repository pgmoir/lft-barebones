     "Last trams will continue to run between midnight and 00:30.",
     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'Our trams are a highly popular way of getting around south London and stepping up the evening services will make it much easier for anyone going home from work or heading for a night out in that bustling part of the Capital to do so.'",
     "Transport for London (TfL) is also looking to secure extra trams for its network, which would run as a new service between Elmers End and Therapia Lane and the intention is to have the new trams up and running next year.",
     "Director of Tramlink, Phil Hewitt, said: 'We are pleased to be able to offer passengers an increase in this service, which will make off-peak evening travel more appealing and convenient with trams running every seven to eight.",
     "'It is part of Transport for London's ongoing campaign to make tram travel a more popular option for travellers.'",
