     "Three other poems by British poets continue this theme of the power of poetry to record the world and to give weight to memory and hope.",
     "The Windhover by Gerard Manley Hopkins is written in Hopkins's personal language of religious ecstasy, At Sixty by Scottish poet Christine de Luca about reaching the age of sixty was originally written in Shetlandic, a Scots dialect still spoken in the Shetland Isles, and Ourstory by Carole Satyamurti is a tribute to the unsung 'awkward women' whose tenacity helped to liberate the lives of women today.",
     "Customers can also pick up leaflets of the poems in this collection at five Tube stations from Friday 10 June.",

This includes the introduction of new track and signalling and the rebuilding of some of our most important stations. By the end of the current programme there will be 30% more capacity. This will inevitably result in some disruption for passengers, but TfL is working hard to provide information and alternative travel options. The work is essential to provide for London's growing transport needs now, and into the future. TfL is urging all Londoners and Tube, London Overground, London Tramlink and DLR passengers to \\\"check before you travel\\\" at weekends, allowing extra journey time where necessary.
