     "London Underground (LU) has awarded Bombardier Transportation the contract to upgrade the signalling on the Circle, District, Hammersmith \u0026 City and Metropolitan lines.",
     "The new signalling contract was finalised over the weekend following a statutory 'standstill' period.",
     "Alongside the fleet of 191 new air-conditioned walk-through trains, already being rolled out on the Metropolitan line, the new signalling system, when complete, will mean passengers can travel more quickly, and frequently on all of the sub-surface lines, which together make up 40 per cent of the Tube network.",

     "Overall the upgrade, which is due for completion in 2018, will mean:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"24 per cent more capacity on the District line by providing space for an extra 10,000 passengers an hour - increasing the line's capacity from 40,000 to 50,000 passengers an hour\",\"27 per cent more capacity on the Metropolitan line by providing space for an extra 9,500 more passengers an hour - increasing the line's capacity from 35,000 to 44,500 passengers an hour\",\"65 per cent more capacity on the Circle and Hammersmith \\u0026 City lines, delivered through new signalling, longer trains and recent improvements to service frequency. In total the upgrade will provide space for an extra 17,500 more passengers each hour - increasing the capacity from 26,000 to 43,500 passengers an hour\"]}",
     "As a result, Bombardier Transportation, who recently upgraded the signalling on the Madrid Metro, has committed to installing and testing the new signalling system without any need for weekend closures.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Moving millions\"}",
     "There will still be a need for weekend closures to upgrade track and platforms, however these will not be the full line closures that have been experienced during previous upgrade work on other lines under the Public Private Partnership (PPP).",
     "Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, said: 'The signing of this contract means that we can now proceed with one of the most important elements of the Tube upgrade programme.",
     "'The Circle, District, Hammersmith \u0026 City and Metropolitan lines are the oldest in the Capital, making up a large chunk of the Tube network and moving a million Londoners every day.",
     "'This new contract will deliver the minimum amount of closures while delivering the improvements all Londoners are desperate to see.'",
     "LU Managing Director, Mike Brown said: 'This is a major step forward in our plan to upgrade the Tube and will mean faster, more frequent and reliable Tube services across 40 per cent of the Tube network.",
     "'We know that line closures are disruptive to our customers and as a result we have insisted on the delivery of the new signalling system without the need for the kind of closures we have seen on other lines.'",

     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Following the collapse of the PPP and failed PPP contractor Metronet in June 2007, LU was left with a number of contracts which were not fit for purpose. One of these was a contract for a new signalling system on the sub-surface lines. LU decided to retender, as the original contract did not provide the best technical solution or the best value for fare payer and taxpayer money. It would also have left LU with the legacy of signalling system not compatible with others across the Tube network, not only inefficient but would have lead to greater infrastructure, maintenance and training costs. The new contract and the efficiencies it will deliver means Transport for London will save hundreds of millions of pounds, now and in future, on the original PPP solution\",\"LU issued an invitation to tender for this contract in July 2009 and, since then, has been engaged in a competitive negotiated procedure with a number of bidders. In April 2011, Bombardier Transportation was selected as the preferred bidder\",\"The sub-surface lines cover more than 300km of track and serve around 40 per cent of the Tube network\",\"Bombardier will install the CITYFLO 650 ATC system, a state-of-the-art communication-based train control technology, which has been successfully deployed on other world metros, including the Metro de Madrid\",\"In December 2009 LU extended the Circle line from Edgware Road to Hammersmith, along the Hammersmith \\u0026 City tracks. This enabled the running of trains more frequently between Edgware Road and Hammersmith. Now there are twice as many trains running on this section of the line\"]}"
