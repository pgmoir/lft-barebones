     "Since 2001, NVQs have been awarded to a wide range of employees at London Underground including station staff, train drivers, signallers and the engineering workforce.",
     "Following the launch of TfL's Skills and Employment Strategy in December 2008 the opportunity to complete an NVQ expanded further to cover other roles across TfL including administration, customer service and management employees, and are also now being offered as part of adult apprentice programmes.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Behind the scenes\"}",
     "Iain Smith, Head of Skills TfL said: 'Being able to offer such opportunities to our staff is essential to ensure TfL's customers receive the best possible service from staff who keep London moving both on the frontline and behind the scenes.",
     "'This is such a significant milestone for us to reach, 10,000 NVQs awarded in ten years.",
     "'It is a great achievement and proves how committed we are to giving staff the opportunity to better their skills, build confidence, boost motivation and receive a nationally recognised qualification.",
     "'These values ensure staff can contribute towards the running of a safe, efficient and customer focussed transport service.'",
     "Staff can gain NVQs in Rail Operations, Rail Engineering, Customer Services, Administration and Management, and programmes last between one and two years.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Significant milestone\"}",
     "The courses are integrated as much as possible with the staff member's day job to avoid unnecessary repetition and also capture real evidence of performance.",
     "The opportunity to gain qualifications ties in closely with the Mayor of London's responsible procurement and skills agenda.",
     "Last month Boris Johnson announced that 2.000 job opportunities had been created in the GLA group in the past two years.",
     "VQ Day is a national celebration of vocational qualifications for students, teachers and employers, and TfL is proud to contribute to this day by celebrating the 10,000 landmark; a number that will continue to grow.",
