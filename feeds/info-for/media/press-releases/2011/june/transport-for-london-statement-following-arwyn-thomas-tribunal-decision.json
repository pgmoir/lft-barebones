     "The Tribunal found that London Underground (LU) were entitled to discipline Mr Thomas because of his actions, that he was not dismissed for his union activities - contrary to the claims of the RMT leadership - and that he was 50 per cent blameworthy for his dismissal.",
     "However, the Tribunal also found that the sanction of dismissal was too severe. Mr Thomas has therefore been offered re-employment, but with a number of conditions that recognise the seriousness of his offence, including:",
