     "The Mayor and TfL have led the way across the public sector in delivering value for money through the implementation of a £7.6bn savings and efficiencies programme while protecting essential upgrade and frontline services.",
     "Actions already taken have secured £4.6bn in savings by 2017/18 and a range of initiatives are being put into place across TfL to deliver the remainder.",
     "Despite an eight per cent reduction in TfL's overall budget following the Government's Spending Review, unprecedented levels of investment in upgrades, extensions and frontline services are being maintained.",

     "'It is absolutely imperative now that we continue in this vein, improving the reliability of our transport network and increasing capacity and I know that TfL staff are up for this challenge.'",
     "The TfL Annual Report and Statement of Accounts also set out, as it does each year, senior remuneration across the TfL group of companies.",
     "For the first time this year, the figures include those from Tube Lines.",
     "The figures show that although there has been an increase in the overall number of people who received total remuneration of more than £100,000 in 2010/11, this is due to the acquisition of Tube Lines in June 2010, an increase at Crossrail as it recruits more staff and enters the delivery phase of the project, and an increase in the number of people across TfL whose total remuneration exceeded £100,000 due to severance  payments.",
     "The number of people earning total remuneration of more than £100,000 across the TfL group of companies in 2010/11 was 379.",
     "This includes 68 employed at Tube Lines (37 of these staff have since left TfL), 84 people who left TfL in the last year and received total remuneration of more than £100,000 through a combination of their salary and severance and 31 senior staff at Crossrail.",
     "Therefore, the baseline number in 2010/11 was 196, roughly equal to 194 in 2009/10.",
     "TfL is also reducing the number of Director-level positions by 25 per cent, or 13 posts, as it restructures the organisation.",
     "In recognition of the difficult economic climate, the salaries of senior TfL staff in 2010/11 were frozen for a second consecutive year, and in addition the Commissioner of Transport, Peter Hendy, and all Chief Officers declined their performance awards for achievements in 2009/10.",
