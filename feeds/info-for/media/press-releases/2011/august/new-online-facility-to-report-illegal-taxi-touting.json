     "Steve Burton, Director of Community Safety, Enforcement and Policing at TfL, said: 'Unbooked minicabs can pose a serious risk to the travelling public across London, especially in busy town centres.",

     "Illegal 'cabs' also present a threat to licensed and law-abiding taxi and private hire drivers as they intercept potential customers and represent unfair - and unsustainable - competition. If a driver or private hire operator is found to be touting TfL will revoke their licences for a minimum period of 12 months.",
