     "They will also shorten journey times by up to 16 per cent as trains will run almost every two minutes.",
     "The fleet is more accessible than before, with wider doors and more spaces for wheelchair users, with on-board audio and visual information for deaf and visually impaired passengers.",
     "CCTV is now in every carriage.",
     "David Waboso, London Underground's Capital Programmes Director, said: 'In two months we will be running an additional two trains per hour for a large part of the week, with further increases to come starting next spring when we'll be running 30 trains every hour ahead of the Olympics.",
     "'When the upgrade is complete we will have provided capacity for an additional 10,000 passengers each hour - meaning better, less crowded, journeys.'",
     "The new trains use a regenerative braking system which returns power to the rails while the train is braking so that other nearby trains can use it for accelerating - reducing the amount of heat that is generated.",
     "Work has also begun to double the capacity of fans in the main ventilation shafts serving the line and is due to be completed later this year.",
     "Eleven fans have already been upgraded and work on the final two is under way.",

     "The roll-out of the new fleet comes 40 years after the line was extended from Victoria to Brixton in July 1971.",
     "It was the first automated train line in the world and, with its ticket barriers and new ticket machines, was ahead of its time.",
     "The first section opened in September 1968, from Walthamstow Central to Highbury \u0026 Islington.",
     "The second, which included King's Cross St. Pancras, Euston and Warren Street, opened in December 1968.",
     "It was officially opened by the Queen in March 1969 when the line arrived at Oxford Circus, Green Park and Victoria Underground stations."
