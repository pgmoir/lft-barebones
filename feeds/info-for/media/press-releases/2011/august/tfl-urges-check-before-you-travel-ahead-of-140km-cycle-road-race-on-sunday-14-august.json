     "Transport for London (TfL), working with the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd (LOCOG), Surrey County Council and the boroughs along the route, is advising people to plan their travel in central and south west London on Sunday 14 August, when the London-Surrey Cycle Classic cycle road race, a London 2012 test event, will take place.",
     "The London-Surrey Cycle Classic  will replicate next year's 2012 Games Cycle Road Race route and is an important event in the 'London prepares' series of LOCOG's testing programme for 2012.",
     "Some of the best road cyclists in the world will follow a 140km route from the heart of the Capital down to Surrey and back again.",
     "Starting at the Mall, and returning there for a thrilling climax, the internationally renowned cyclists will race through six of south west London's boroughs, and parts of Surrey, passing famous locations such as Buckingham Palace, Richmond Park and Hampton Court Palace.",
     "The race will run on fully closed roads, and streets on and near the race route will not be open for most of the day and will have additional parking controls.",
     "There will be a major impact on road transport, including buses, along the route and people are strongly advised to plan their travel for the day by visiting \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/testevent\"\u003etfl.gov.uk/testevent\u003c/a\u003e .",

     "Garrett Emmerson, TfL's Chief Operating Officer for London Streets, said: 'The London-Surrey Cycle Classic Road Race will play an important role in ensuring transport and the Capital are fully prepared for the 2012 Games.",
     "'London is used to hosting successful major events, and will do so again this August when some of the world's greatest cyclists battle it out through the streets of London and Surrey.",
     "'However, there will be a major impact on road transport on the day, with many roads closed, and we strongly advise people to plan their travel that weekend and avoid driving in south west and central London if at all possible.'",
     "London 2012 Chairman Seb Coe said: 'This is going to be a fantastic race and our course, with its interesting route and impressive technical elements, has attracted the best nations and pro cycling teams in the world so this really is a trial run for the Games in 2012.'",
     "'However, as with any major road event, in particular one that moves through so many different areas of London and the South East, there will be a significant impact on traffic and transport.",
     "'We want to draw attention to this to make sure people plan their weekend accordingly.'",
     "To allow access across closed roads on the race route, pedestrian access will still be possible at designated crossings, where marshals will ensure people can cross the road safely.",
     "Zebra and pelican crossings as well as traffic signals will remain on, but will not apply to vehicles involved in the London-Surrey Cycle Classic Road Race.",
     "This means that while the route is closed, Road Race vehicles may be travelling at high speeds.",
     "Extreme caution is advised when crossing these roads.",
