     "The key travel 'hotspots' were previewed as the Mayor, Olympics Transport Minister, Transport Commissioner and London 2012 partners addressed small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from across the capital at a specially organised event, 'Make 2012 Work for You', held at BT Centre.",
     "Businesses attending the event were shown examples of how busy the road and Tube networks could be during the London 2012 Games before any action is taken by businesses and freight operators to change their travel patterns.",
     "Also, how much the impact will be reduced if businesses follow the advice of TfL and London 2012 and plan ahead to ensure they can keep on running and make the most of the great financial opportunities offered by the Games.",
     "The information released by TfL comes in response to requests from London's business community for further detailed information to help them plan ahead of the Games.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy called on the capital's businesses and SMEs to use a new 'one stop shop' at the TfL website, also launched today, to plan ahead effectively.",
     "The new TfL 'one stop shop' website brings together a combination of new and existing transport information in one easy to access location, \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/2012\"\u003etfl.gov.uk/2012\u003c/a\u003e .",

     "The Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: 'It is absolutely vital that London's small and medium sized businesses, the backbone of the capital's economy, are fully prepared and ready to take advantage of every opportunity that hosting the greatest show on earth brings.",
     "'Making sure they have the most up-to-date and relevant transport information is a crucial part of this preparation allowing them to plan around any disruptions, make sure their staff are where they need to be and their businesses can keep moving as we welcome the world to our great city.'",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy, said: 'Our planning for the Games includes listening and responding to the concerns of the business community.",
     "'That's why we're providing more detailed transport information now, with even more to come, and a new 'one stop shop' online to make it as easy as possible to find and use.",
     "'Our analysis shows that no two days will be the same during the London 2012 Games. I am confident London will provide the stage for the greatest Games we've ever seen.",
     "'But we will only succeed if organisations across the capital, big and small, join us in planning ahead now to help us reduce the impact on our transport network and ensure they can keep on running next summer.'",
     "Olympic Transport Minister Theresa Villiers, said: 'The Games will give this country a massive boost and deliver a legacy for London and the UK that will be felt for decades to come.",
     "'But the Games will have an impact on getting around London and it's important that businesses start planning for this now - including how they make and receive deliveries during summer 2012 and how staff need to adapt their travel patterns.",
     "'The Department for Transport is helping to lead the way as a London employer - we're committed to reducing our travel footprint by 50 per cent at Games time.",
     "'With events like today's, and TfL's one-stop-shop, we can work together to minimise disruption and overcrowding on our transport network, and use the Olympics to show the world that London is a world class location for events.'",
     "The public transport data, full details of which is due to be released in November, will show how services on all Tube, DLR, London Overground and key National Rail stations are expected to be affected on a line-by-line, day-by-day basis during the Games, in intervals of 30 minutes.",
     "Preliminary information for London's road hotspot locations, based on recent highways modelling, was also presented at the event and is also due to be released in November.",
