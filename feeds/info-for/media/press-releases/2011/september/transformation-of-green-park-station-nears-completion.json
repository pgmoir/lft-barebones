On the Victoria line platform humps are already being used by passengers with restricted mobility\",\"Tube Lines is continuing the work at the station and surrounding area and will complete it in spring 2012. Tube Lines is a fully owned subsidiary of Transport for London\",\"The Tube is undergoing a huge and essential programme to upgrade its ageing infrastructure - vital to cope with a growing population and to support the economic development and growth of the Capital and the UK. This includes the introduction of new track and signalling and the rebuilding of some of our most important stations. By the end of the current programme there will be 30 per cent more capacity\",\"This will inevitably result in some disruption for passengers, but TfL is working hard to provide information and alternative travel options. The work is essential to provide for London's growing transport needs now, and into the future.

Tube Lines then carried out the detailed design\",\"This autumn the Royal Academy of Arts will present Artists' Laboratory 04, After Cosmati, an environmental sculpture installation by John Maine RA. Maine is best known for making large outdoor sculpture in stone which relates to the surrounding landscape. Maine's work utilises simple forms such as rings, columns and cones. Physical weight and texture also characterise his work which encourages contemplation and a celebration of the elements. His extensive travels have informed his sculpture and he has created monumental installations over the world. Maine's piece will highlight his current interest with bringing the outside into an interior space and creating a greater space within it. The exhibition is open to the public from Wednesday 9 November - Sunday 18 December 2011, 10:00-18:00 daily, Fridays until 22:00. Complimentary entry with a valid Royal Academy exhibition ticket. £3 without an exhibition ticket\"]}"
