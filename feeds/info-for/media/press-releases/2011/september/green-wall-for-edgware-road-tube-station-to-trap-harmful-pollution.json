     "More measures to clean up London's air in areas of busy traffic have been unveiled by the Mayor today.",
     "This includes the announcement that Edgware Road Tube station will soon feature an innovative 'green wall' to help trap harmful pollution.",
     "The initiatives, announced on World Environmental Health Day, are part of the London Clean Air Fund financed by the Department for Transport (DfT) at the Mayor's request, which could reduce levels of PM10 - a pollutant coming mostly from traffic emissions - by between 10 and 20 per cent where applied.",

     "Air quality modelling shows that the vast majority of London already meets the European Commission limit value for annual average PM10, but there are some local hot spots identified as being 'at risk' of exceeding limits.",
     "The European Commission recently confirmed to the UK government that the Mayor's plans to reduce PM10 pollution by a third by 2015 - including the work of the Clean Air Fund - has reduced the threat of hefty fines.",

     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'This is a great example of how we are trying to put the best of the village into the city and work together to create cleaner air for London, and with this latest set of innovations, our assault on pollution - especially near to the busiest roads - is continuing apace.",

     "This work involves the trial of green walls and screens in addition to the 50 6ft planted towers, tree and shrub planting at PM10 hot spots.",
     "From early November a green wall is due to be installed at Edgware Road Tube station on the Bakerloo line, adjacent to Marylebone Road, around 180 square metres of vegetation will cover the wall.",

     "Ahead of launching its best practice guides, TfL has been working with around 120 businesses located within PM10 hot spots including the National Union of Students and Cartwright Pickard Architects.",
     "The guides will provide further information on how businesses can encourage staff to walk and cycle more as part of their commute and travelling to and from business meetings.",
     "As part of this programme TfL has the use of 12 electric pool bikes provided by Trek, which are being trialled by selected businesses to provide an alternative means of travel for business meetings.",

     "Robin Gargrave, Director of Innovation and Development at Central YMCA, said: 'Central YMCA are delighted to be working with TfL to help get London's workforce more active.",
     "'Active transport in the form of walking will contribute to individual health, employee productivity and improved air quality.",
     "'Driven by the belief that everyone has the right to access the health benefits of physical activity, I believe that the CYMCA 'Workplace Activator' model which trains a cohort of employees to support their colleagues to take up and make walking a habitual method of getting around London, in tandem with the Mayor's clean air programme can support organisations in reducing their environmental impact.'",

     "The Clean Air Fund measures will be used flexibly where PM10 levels are highest, allowing for the fact that London's pollution levels can be weather dependent and influenced by pollution from outside the Capital.",
     "Garrett Emmerson, Chief Operating Officer at TfL, said: 'Work to increase the green infrastructure will rapidly increase as planting for the green wall at Edgware Road Tube station and a number of trees and shrubs along PM10 hot spots gets under way in November.",
     "'Much work has also been done engaging with businesses to encourage them to consider more sustainable practices and provide support on introducing greener ways of working.",
     "'We are beginning to implement a number of projects from the Clean Air Fund now and Londoners are likely to start noticing these.",
     "'These are measures we can introduce to target local PM10 hotspots and put in place fairly quickly and build on our continuing work to improve air quality across London.'",
