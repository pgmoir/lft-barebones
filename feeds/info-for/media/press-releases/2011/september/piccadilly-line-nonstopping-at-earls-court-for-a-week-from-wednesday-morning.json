     "If the escalator fails it can not be used as a fixed staircase and, due to the limited space available to carry out works on the faulty escalator and only a narrow spiral staircase as a backup, LU will need to close the landing area around the escalator to carry out the works.",
     "LU's maintenance teams will be working flat out to complete the work between Tuesday night and the start of services on Wednesday 21, limiting disruption to regular customers and those attending events in the local area.",
     "LU's Chief Operating Officer, Howard Collins, said: 'We work hard to plan maintenance and upgrade work as far ahead as possible, but on occasion we are left with no choice but to crack on with emergency repair work in the way which will cause the least disruption for customers.",
     "'I know this will inconvenience some customers and I apologise for that, but it is vital that we get this work done now to save more disruption later. In the meantime customers can interchange between the Piccadilly and District lines at Hammersmith, Baron's Court and South Kensington.'",
     "The Tube is undergoing a huge and essential programme to upgrade its ageing infrastructure - vital to cope with a growing population and to support the economic development and growth of the capital and the UK. This includes the introduction of new track and signalling and the rebuilding of some of our most important stations. By the end of the current programme there will be 30 per centÂ more capacity. This will inevitably result in some disruption for passengers, but TfL is working hard to provide information and alternative travel options. The work is essential to provide for London's growing transport needs now, and into the future. TfL is urging all Londoners and Tube, London Overground, London Tramlink and Docklands Light Railway passengers to 'check before you travel' at weekends, allowing extra journey time where necessary.
