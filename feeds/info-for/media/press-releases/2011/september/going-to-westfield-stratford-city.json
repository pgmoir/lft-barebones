     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy said:",
     "'With our partners, we've invested to ensure all transport improvements are complete ahead of the opening of Westfield Stratford City and well ahead of the London 2012 Games. This part of east London is now one of the best connected in the country and Londoners are already benefitting from this early legacy.",
     "'We have transport and traffic plans in place to manage the increase in people travelling to Westfield. However, these plans are very different to those we will put in place during the Games, when 100 per cent of spectators will travel by public transport, walking or cycling.",

     "Due to the centre's proximity to the Olympic Park, the vehicle screening areas (VSAs) are operational from now until the end of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in September 2012.",
     "LOCOG will be working with its security provider G4S to operate vehicle screening areas, providing security checks on vehicles.",
     "The screening areas will be similar to others which operate at shopping centres in secure areas and will be based at Warton Road, Penny Brookes Street and the Lea Interchange off the A12.",
     "Security checks will have minimal impact on shoppers' journeys with vehicles chosen to be searched directed out of the traffic flow to be checked before continuing their journey into Westfield car parks.",
     "Over the last 10 months, London 2012 has undertaken a local consultation and communications programme aimed at local residents, especially in the Warton Road area, to ensure the plans have as little impact as possible on the daily lives of local residents.",
     "LOCOG Chief Executive Officer Paul Deighton said:",
     "'Delivering a safe and secure Games is a key priority for everyone involved in London 2012. With Westfield so close to the Olympic Park and with vehicle access to it directly accessed from the Park, it is an obvious and important part of our security plans.",
     "'We will make the checks as quick and unobtrusive as possible - we are confident that shoppers will recognise the need for us to be vigilant and carry out these checks. We are also committed to working with the local community to ensure that vehicle screenings have a minimal impact on their daily lives.'",
