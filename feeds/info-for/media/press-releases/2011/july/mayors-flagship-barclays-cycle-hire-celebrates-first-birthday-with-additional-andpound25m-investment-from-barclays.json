     "The additional £25m takes Barclays total investment in the scheme to £50m.",
     "The Mayor has asked Transport for London (TfL) to prepare plans for a westward expansion of the scheme through the boroughs of Wandsworth, Hammersmith \u0026 Fulham, Lambeth and Kensington \u0026 Chelsea.",

     "'My thanks go to Barclays for the benevolence they have demonstrated with their latest bestowal of funds and that we can confirm the extension of their sponsorship agreement. By working together we are putting thousands more Londoners on two wheels.",
     "'My thanks also go to the boroughs who have been champing at the bit for an expansion of this scheme, and to Westfield London for providing an investment that from next year will enable hordes of shoppers to make the journey to their glittering halls by the cleanest, greenest and most enjoyable form of transport available.'",
     "Last year the Mayor announced that by spring 2012 the Barclays Cycle Hire area will extend beyond central London to include all of the Borough of Tower Hamlets as well as North Shoreditch in the Borough of Hackney.",
     "People living in Bethnal Green, Bow, Canary Wharf, Mile End and Poplar will also see docking stations built in their communities.",

     "Bob Diamond, Chief Executive, Barclays Bank PLC, said: 'Barclays Cycle Hire has undoubtedly been a huge success so far.",
     "'Now even more people across London will benefit from this pioneering scheme, which makes a positive difference to everyday life in London, its people and its economy.",
     "'Barclays commitment to citizenship, including the role we play in the communities we serve, is one of Barclays four execution priorities.",

     "Michael Gutman, European Managing Director for Westfield, said: 'We are pleased to support Barclays Cycle Hire which will compliment the extensive public transport and road network surrounding Westfield London.",
     "'The initiative has been a huge success in its first year and the extension will make London's top destinations even more accessible.'",
     "Councillor Russell King, Wandsworth's transport spokesman, said: 'These bikes have revolutionised the way people travel around London and we look forward to seeing the benefits extended south west.'",
     "Councillor Harry Phibbs, Hammersmith \u0026 Fulham's Council's cabinet member for community engagement, says: 'Rolling out Barclays Cycle Hire westwards is the best transport news the borough has enjoyed since the extension of the congestion charge was scrapped.",
     "'Pedal power promises to relieve some of the pressure on our congested roads and jam-packed tubes, reduce pollution and give residents another option when choosing how to get around.",
     "'The Barclays Cycle Hire scheme will also make it easier for visitors to get to our major attractions.'",
     "Londoners using the Mayor's flagship scheme, Barclays Cycle Hire, have made more than six million cycle journeys since it launched just one year ago.",
     "On its busiest day of operation so far more than 29,200 cycle journeys were made using Barclays Cycle Hire.",
     "More than 128,000 people are now Barclays Cycle Hire members and casual customers have already made more than one million cycle journeys since the scheme was launched to casual customers just seven months ago.",

     "'The bikes are now an increasingly popular sight across central London and have transformed they way people make short trips around the Capital.",
     "'Work is already well underway for the eastern extension which will be completed by spring 2012.'",
     "Becoming a Barclays Cycle Hire member still remains the fastest way to access a bike with no queuing at the on street terminals.",
     "UK residents can start using the cycle hire scheme as a member for just £4 - the cost of buying the membership key (£3) and their first 24-hour access period (£1).",
