     "The 2012 Games will provide fantastic opportunities for businesses in the Capital and across the UK.",
     "TfL and London 2012 are determined to ensure that businesses can take advantage of all these opportunities and have today announced two new programmes to help small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and multi-site businesses run smoothly - and minimise any transport challenges - during the 2012 Games.",
     "From August, multi-site companies employing more than 200 people, such as retail outlets, restaurant chains and financial institutions, can receive bespoke advice to help them devise and implement travel action plans for their organisations during the summer of 2012.",
     "Each session will help firms manage the impact of the Games on staff and business operations and optimise deliveries, servicing and freight during Games time.",
     "This new programme, which is seeking to work with at least 100 multi-site companies, mirrors the support already available to organisations that employ more than 200 people at a single location.",
     "Also from next month, and until summer next year, more than 50 free workshops will be rolled out across the country.",
     "These will be for firms with less than 200 employees that are based in areas set to be most impacted by the 2012 Games.",
     "The drop-in sessions will help small and medium-sized enterprises prepare for any travel disruption that may affect their business, and will cover topics such as how local roads will be managed, optimising deliveries and offering flexible working during Games time.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Free workshops\"}",

     "After answering the questions, the travel planning tool provides companies with suggested actions and the considerations they will need to take into account.",
     "Any business can start planning now by visiting the website and selecting 'Make your Plan'.",
     "Leon Daniels, Managing Director of Surface Transport at TfL, said: 'TfL and all partners are fully focused on delivering what will undoubtedly be a fantastic London 2012 Games and legacy for the Capital and UK and ensuring businesses are ready to make the most of all the opportunities on offer.",

I'd like to urge all businesses to take advantage of the tools that are available to them now, so that they can plan ahead and make the most of the London 2012 Games.'",

     "David Waterman from I. Waterman (Box Makers) Ltd, a company formed in 1897 that is based in east London and employs 16 staff, said: 'These workshops are just what small businesses like mine are after.",
     "'Face-to-face sessions like these are the best way to get instant answers to questions and work through any issues to ensure our business is ready for the Games.",
