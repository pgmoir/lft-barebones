     "Our pilot routes have proved a great success with lots more Londoners leaping into the saddle, and telling us they feel safer on the road. I'm confident our new cycle superhighways will prove just as popular.",
     "The two new routes run from Bow to Aldgate and Wandsworth to Westminster.",
     "They will contribute to the Mayor's aim of bringing a cycle revolution to the capital by making it easier and safer for cyclists to commute into central London on direct and continuous cycle routes.",
     "Considerable improvements have been made to infrastructure along both of the new routes to benefit both cyclists and other road users.",
     "On the Wandsworth to Westminster route dedicated cycle only lanes have been introduced along Grosvenor Road and Millbank and a new off-road cycle path has been created alongside Wandsworth Bridge roundabout.",
     "On the Bow to Aldgate route major improvements have been made to the junction of Cambridge Heath Road and Whitechapel Road to make the area easier for cyclists, motorists and pedestrians to use.",
     "Significant improvements have also been made at Bow roundabout and a number of other junctions to assist cyclists and to provide a continuous and navigable route along the Superhighway.",
     "Last year the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, launched the first two pilot routes, which run from Merton to the City and Barking to Tower Gateway.",
     "New data released by Transport for London today indicates that since the pilot Superhighways were introduced cycling has increased by 46 per cent along the Merton to City route, and by 83 per cent along the Barking to Tower Gateway route.",
     "On some sections of the route cycling increased by more than 100 per cent, and over three quarters of cyclists on the routes use them for travelling to and from work.",
     "The new research also revealed that 80 per cent of users surveyed felt Barclays Cycle Superhighways improved safety for cyclists.",
     "Two thirds of users claimed the blue surfacing helps them to feel safer on the road, and that the general public gives more space to cyclists because of the blue surfacing, especially at junctions and roundabouts.",
     "Kulveer Ranger, the Mayor of London's Director for Environment, said: 'These vivid blue routes make the world of difference for cyclists on the streets of London, and prove a powerful and visible statement on our roads that assert to every Londoner, whether on two wheels or four, that the capital is a cycling city.",
     "'Our pilot routes have proved a great success with lots more Londoners leaping into the saddle, and telling us they feel safer on the road. I'm confident our new cycle superhighways will prove just as popular.'",
     "Part of the new Barclays Cycle Superhighways package is funding for the five London boroughs and local businesses along each route to increase cycle parking and to provide cycle safety checks and cycle training.",
     "581 businesses have expressed interest in the funding and 71 have already registered for it.",
     "With more and more cyclists taking to the road in the capital, Transport for London and the Mayor are working hard to make sure cycling in London continues to get safer. TfL offers free cycle training which we would encourage new and experienced cyclists to take full advantage of. For further information visit: \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/cycling\"\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk/cycling\u003c/a\u003e ",
     "It is important that cyclists are aware of key cycle safety tips such as wearing bright clothing and never going up the left-hand side of lorries at junctions.",
     "Drivers are also reminded that cyclists are 'vehicles' on the road and just like any other vehicle they require space, consideration and awareness.",
     "Ben Plowden, TfL Director of Better Routes and Places, said: 'We now have four Barclays Cycle Superhighway routes in operation which is a great achievement over a relatively short period of time.",
     "'Our pilot route research indicates that more and more people are using the routes to cycle to and from work which goes to show that Londoners are recognising that cycling is not only good for your health and fitness but it is also extremely good for your wallet.",
     "'I'm sure like the pilot routes, our new cycle superhighways will be popular with residents that live near the Barclays Cycle Superhighways so they are able to take full advantage of the benefits of cycling in London.'",
     "The Mayor and TfL are investing record amounts in cycling for the Barclays Cycle Superhighways, Barclays Cycle Hire, cycle infrastructure, training and education.",
     "Over the last year cycling has increased by 15 per cent along the TLRN and by 150 per cent since 2000. This equates to around half a million cycle journeys across London each day.",
     "\u003cbr /\u003eDeanna Oppenheimer, Vice-Chair, Retail and Business Banking at Barclays, said: 'Over the course of the last 12 months, research has shown how thousands of Londoners have used the first two Barclays Cycle Superhighways. The additional routes launched today will provide further options for people to get around the Capital in an environmentally friendly and healthy way.",
     "'Together with Barclays Cycle Hire, both schemes are having a positive impact on London and the lives of Londoners.'\u003cbr /\u003e",
