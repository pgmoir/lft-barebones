     "Whether you are at home wondering it you have time to finish that cup of coffee, or need to maximise time in the office or between meetings, you won't have to waste time or get cold waiting at a bus stop again.",

     "The new signs have improved visibility for visually impaired passengers and will display more travel information than the old signs.",
     "Later this year all the data will be made freely available for developers to design specific smart phones applications around it, making it even easier for Londoners to find out exactly where their bus is.",
