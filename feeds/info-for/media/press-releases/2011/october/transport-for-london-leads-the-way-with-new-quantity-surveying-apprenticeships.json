     "The apprenticeships began in September and will last two years.",
     "Apprentices attend college one day a week and then spend the rest of the time getting hands on experience with their employer.",
     "On completion of the two-year apprenticeship programme, apprentices will be able to achieve Associate membership of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors giving them a clear progression pathway to full chartered status.",
     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'To reach our target of 100,000 apprenticeships in London, we will need to work with a really broad cross section of employers to make sure there are as many routes as possible for apprentices to find their way into professional jobs.",
     "'This new apprenticeship scheme, developed by TfL in partnership with business, is great news for budding quantity surveyors and a fantastic example for us to follow in the future.'",

     "'Over the next two years, I know that the skills and knowledge I will gain will be invaluable.",
     "'The TfL apprenticeship scheme is the ideal stepping stone for anyone who aspires to become a fully qualified quantity surveyor and I fully recommend it.'",
     "Martyn Brocks, Programme Commercial Manager at TfL said: 'We have worked closely with the Supplier Skills Team, CSTT and our suppliers, to develop this unique apprenticeship in quantity surveying.",
     "'I'm delighted with the progress so far and the commitment from our suppliers and am sure this scheme can be rolled out further in the future.",
     "'This apprenticeship provides a great opportunity for young Londoners to get into a profession that offers real career progression.",
     "'The range of projects they are involved in across London also means they have the chance to play a part in the growth of the city.'",
