     "We are excited and privileged to be working with Kusama on this project. Polka Dots Festival in London presents a unique interpretation of the pace and colour of life in our capital",
     "The design is entitled Polka Dots Festival in London and will appear on the front cover of millions of pocket Tube maps from Monday,Â 12 December.",
     "For the commission, Kusama, whose career spans a remarkable seven decades, uses her signature pattern of cartoon-like dots, in the Tube map colours.",
     "Red, green, blue and yellow dots spill across the image creating a sense of endless variation and eternity.",
     "There is a psychedelic intensity to the patterning that gives a snapshot of the artist's meditative state and dynamic vision.",
     "Kusama said: 'The dots are spreading out over the earth and beyond, onto the infinite great universe. Like these dots, London is a progressive and ever changing force with a spectrum of colours that echo a vibrancy of life and how brilliantly it shines!'",
     "Head of Art on the Underground, Tamsin Dillon, said: 'We are excited and privileged to be working with Kusama on this project. Polka Dots Festival in London presents a unique interpretation of the pace and colour of life in our capital.",

     "Kusama's work is the latest in a long series of commissions by Art on the Underground for the pocket Tube map cover.",
     "Other artists in the series include: Michael Landy, Barbara Kruger, Jeremy Deller, Richard Long, Pae White and Mark Wallinger.",
     "Art on the Underground's commission coincides with Kusama's major forthcoming exhibition at Tate Modern from 9 February to 5 June 2012.",
     "The exhibition will be her most extensive UK show to date and will include seminal works such as: Lingering Dream (1949), 1000 Boats show (1963), I'm Here, but Nothing (2000-) and Infinity Mirrored Room - Filled with the Brilliance of Life (2011).",

This includes the introduction of new track and signalling and the rebuilding of some of our most important stations. By the end of the current programme there will be 30 per cent more capacity. This will inevitably result in some disruption for passengers, but TfL is working hard to provide information and alternative travel options. The work is essential to provide for London's growing transport needs now, and into the future.
