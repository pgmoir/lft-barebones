     "Last year in Barking and Dagenham it financed 290 on-street cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 2,350 children and 130 adults, the removal of 200 metres of guardrail, six new accessible bus stops, two new off-street electric vehicle charging points, 800 new street trees and for 27 schools to participate in walking events and 35 in cycling events.",

     "The funding was previously forecast to reduce year on year to reflect the reduced general grant TfL receives from the Department for Transport.",
     "However, because of the importance of the boroughs in delivering the priorities of Mayor's Transport Strategy, the funding has been kept at a consistent level to 2013/14.",
