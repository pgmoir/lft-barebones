     "The funding has been allocated by Transport for London (TfL) through the Local Implementation Plan (LIP) process and is awarded to the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy, including safer roads, smoothing traffic flow, rejuvenating town centres and better facilities for cycling and walking.",

     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: 'London is undergoing a neo-Victorian level of investment in its transport network.",
     "'Every London borough is receiving money that will directly benefit communities, making London an even better place to live and work.",
     "'We've also cut bureaucracy to make it easier for the boroughs to decide how they want to spend their funding.'",
     "The LIP funds hundreds of large- and small-scale transport projects every year.",
     "Last year in Ealing it financed 20 on-street cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 877 children and 457 adults, nine improved pedestrian crossings, 36 road safety educational events, 14 new accessible bus stops and refreshed 102 School Travel Plans.",
     "Notable larger projects already implemented in Ealing using LIP support include the £1.5m boost for Greenford town centre which has made urban realm improvements, providing residents with a safer, more accessible and pleasant town centre and improved pedestrian and cyclist facilities.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy said: 'Year on year the boroughs continue to deliver innovative projects that support the Mayor's vision for transport in the Capital.",
     "'This investment will build on the excellent work that has already been achieved and complement the huge programme of work we at TfL are undertaking to make his vision a reality through working in partnership with the boroughs.'",
     "The funding was previously forecast to reduce year on year to reflect the reduced general grant TfL receives from the Department for Transport.",
     "However, because of the importance of the boroughs in delivering the priorities of Mayor's Transport Strategy, the funding has been kept at a consistent level to 2013/14.",
