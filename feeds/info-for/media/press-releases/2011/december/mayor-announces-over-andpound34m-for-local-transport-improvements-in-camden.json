     "The funding was previously forecast to reduce year on year to reflect the reduced general grant TfL receives from the Department for Transport.  However, because of the importance of the boroughs in delivering the priorities of Mayor's Transport Strategy, the funding has been kept at a consistent level to 2013/14.",
