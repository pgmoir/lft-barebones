     "Whether you're looking for a leisurely sight-seeing River Tour or a quick commute on a River Bus service, Transport for London's (TfL's) new combined guide to River Thames boat services can help you on your way.",
     "The guide details scheduled River Bus services that depart regularly from many piers along the Thames.",
     "These services are provided on state-of-the-art vessels and include a fast and frequent service from Embankment to Woolwich Arsenal.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Increasing capacity\"}",
     "The Thames is one of London's greatest assets and the Mayor is focused on increasing pier capacity in central London by extending existing piers and encouraging new piers to be built in developing areas such as Nine Elms, Woolwich Arsenal and Barking Riverside.",
     "In September a new privately-funded pier opened at St George Wharf in Vauxhall, and the Tower Millennium Pier will be extended to increase capacity by March next year.",
     "Isabel Dedring, Deputy Mayor for Transport, said: 'The Mayor wants to enable Londoners to make the most of this city's original highway by increasing pier capacity and making river travel more accessible.",
     "'This year we have improved the westwards service, with a new pier now open at St. George Wharf in Vauxhall, and are working to extend Tower Millennium Pier by March next year.",
     "'Services operate all year around and this updated new guide shows what's on offer over the next few months.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"State-of-the-art vessels\"}",
     "Passengers with a valid Travelcard, or an Oyster card loaded with a valid Travelcard, can get a third off single fares on most river services.",
     "On KPMG Thames Clippers the cost of the journey can be taken from any Oyster pay as you go balance.",
     "Passengers with Oyster pay as you go get 10 per cent off the normal KPMG Thames Clippers adult fare.",
     "Andy Griffiths, Head of London River Services, said: 'Winter is often a forgotten season on the River Thames but with warm state-of the-art vessels, many serving drinks and snacks, it gives visitors and residents an opportunity to see many iconic London landmarks, including the Tower of London and the Houses of Parliament, from a fantastic vantage point.",
     "'With the introduction of improved signage, clearer 'Tube style' river maps and new branding along the river it's never been easier to enjoy the Thames.'",
