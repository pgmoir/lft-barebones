Works will include replacing street lighting and resurfacing foot and cycle paths\",\"£100,000 for environmental upgrades to the Briar Road Estate. The funding will also be used to increase signage to the estate and tackle anti-social behaviour as part of the wider regeneration of the estate.

     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: 'London is undergoing a neo-Victorian level of investment in its transport network.",

     "'We've also cut bureaucracy to make it easier for the boroughs to decide how they want to spend their funding.'",
     "The LIP funds hundreds of large- and small-scale transport projects every year.",
     "Last year in Havering it financed cycle training for 3,000 children and 200 adults, 80 road safety education and training events, 11 improved pedestrian crossings, 12 new accessible bus stops and enabled 54 schools to participate in walking events.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy said: 'Year on year the boroughs continue to deliver innovative projects that support the Mayor's vision for transport in the Capital.",
     "'This investment will build on the excellent work that has already been achieved and complement the huge programme of work we at TfL are undertaking to make his vision a reality through working in partnership with the boroughs.'",
     "The funding was previously forecast to reduce year on year to reflect the reduced general grant TfL receives from the Department for Transport.",
     "However, because of the importance of the boroughs in delivering the priorities of Mayor's Transport Strategy, the funding has been kept at a consistent level to 2013/14.",
