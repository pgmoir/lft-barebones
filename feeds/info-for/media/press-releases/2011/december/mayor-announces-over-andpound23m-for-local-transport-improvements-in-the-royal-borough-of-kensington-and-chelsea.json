     "Every London borough is receiving money that will directly benefit communities, making London an even better place to live and work.",
     "The funding has been allocated by Transport for London (TfL) through the Local Implementation Plan (LIP) process and is awarded to the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy, including safer roads, smoothing traffic flow, rejuvenating town centres and better facilities for cycling and walking.",

     "'Every London borough is receiving money that will directly benefit communities, making London an even better place to live and work.",
     "'We've also cut bureaucracy to make it easier for the boroughs to decide how they want to spend their funding.'",
     "The LIP funds hundreds of large and small scale transport projects every year.",
     "Last year in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea it financed 574 cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 660 children and 230 adults, the removal of 435 metres of guardrail, 55 road safety education and training events, 19 new accessible bus stops, 32 schools and 26 workplaces to participate in walking events, 34 schools and 41 workplaces to participate in cycling events and 12 new trees.",

     "Notable larger projects undertaken in Kensington and Chelsea this year include the Exhibition Road project which used £13.4m of LIP funding towards the £23m shared space project using an iconic diamond design and street lighting between the museums of Albertropolis.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy, said: 'Year on year the boroughs continue to deliver innovative projects that support the Mayor's vision for transport in the Capital.",
     "'This investment will build on the excellent work that has already been achieved and complement the huge programme of work we at TfL are undertaking to make his vision a reality through working in partnership with the boroughs.'",
     "The funding was previously forecast to reduce year on year to reflect the reduced general grant TfL receives from the Department for Transport.",
     "However, because of the importance of the boroughs in delivering the priorities of Mayor's Transport Strategy, the funding has been kept at a consistent level to 2013/14.",
