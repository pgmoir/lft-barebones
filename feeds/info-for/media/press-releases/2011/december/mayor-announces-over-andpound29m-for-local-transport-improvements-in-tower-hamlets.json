Work will also include measures to smooth the flow of traffic to improve bus journey times as well as creating green spaces\",\"£300,000 to improve the junctions of Vallance Road with Whitechapel Road, working with TfL, to improve safety and complement developments in the area\",\"£500,000 to continue works to transform St. Paul's Way and complement the major redevelopment of that area which is now taking place. Improvements include better lighting, de-cluttering, guardrail removal, tree planting and widening footpaths as well as reduced carriageway width.  Road surfaces will also be levelled to pavement level at side roads to make it easier for people using wheelchairs or those with buggies as well as to encourage lower vehicle speeds. Other works will include making bus stops and pedestrian crossings more accessible, and the creation of shared space which will improve access to local shops.\"]}",
