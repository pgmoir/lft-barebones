     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, today announced that \u003ca href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Fares Direction for Jan 12 v5 (2) tables_0.pdf\"\u003efares on TfL's services for 2012 \u003c/a\u003e will rise by just above inflation, 5.6 per cent on average, after he secured £136m from the Government to help the Capital's commuters.",
     "The lower than planned rise in fares will be entirely paid for by the additional funding provided by the Government and comes at no cost to TfL.",
     "This means there will be no impact on TfL's huge programme of investment in London's transport network or on essential frontline services.",
     "As with any fares packages, some fares will go up by slightly more than RPI plus one per cent, and some slightly less.",
     "The single Oyster pay as you go bus fare now rises by just 5 pence, or only 3.8 per cent.",
     "The Weekly Bus Pass now rises by £1, or 5.6 per cent.",
     "Average Tube fares will rise by RPI plus one per cent (six per cent).",
     "Some Tube fares in Outer London will now be frozen at 2011 levels, while others - Oyster pay as you go peak zones 2-5, 3-6 and 2-6 - will rise by only four per cent, less than inflation.",
     "All Travelcards and Oyster pay as you go caps will benefit from the lower rise in 2012.",
     "The Day peak zone 1-4 Travelcard and cap initially planned to rise by eight per cent will now rise by six per cent and the 7 Day zone 1-2 Travelcard has been held down from an eight per cent increase to only 5.8 per cent.",
     "All free and concessionary travel for older people, students, veterans and disabled Londoners remains protected in full, which means that 40 per cent of bus passengers will continue to travel free or at a substantial concessionary rate.",
     "The average bus fare per journey, including concessions, will be around 60p, compared to an average typical bus fare of around £1 in other UK cities.",
     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'Every penny of this cash injection will go towards keeping fares as low as possible.",
     "'That is very good news in the current economic climate and even better the unprecedented level of investment to improve London's transport network will continue unabated.'",
     "Full details of all TfL fares for 2012 are available on the Greater London Authority website.",
     "Unprecedented investment in London's transport network will continue totalling £12bn over the Mayor's four year term.",
     "This is an increase from an £8bn investment from the previous administration.",
     "The current investment programme includes upgrades to the Tube, now carrying a record 1.1 billion passengers a year, delivery of Crossrail, and the maintenance of London's frequent, extensive, reliable and accessible bus network, which is now carrying almost 2.3 billion passengers a year - more than any other time since records began in the 1960s.",
     "Further extensive improvements have also been made on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) and London Overground, both of which are also experiencing record ridership.",
     "Investment is vital for the transport network to continue to develop and improve and to meet future demand, which is set to grow yet further.",
     "Over the last year alone, investment in London's transport network has delivered:",
