     "'We've also cut bureaucracy to make it easier for the boroughs to decide how they want to spend their funding.'",
     "The LIP funds hundreds of large and small scale transport projects every year.",
     "Last year in Richmond it financed 1,350 cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 2,576 children and168 adults, 27 schools to participate in walking events, 27 smarter driving events to help reduce CO2,12 new on-street car club bays and 800 new street trees.",

     "The improvements have delivered two fully accessible bus stops with more space for safer and more convenient waiting environments.",
     "A new pedestrian crossing facility has been installed to assist interchange at the station between trains and buses and to improve access to the surrounding area.",

     "The funding was previously forecast to reduce year on year to reflect the reduced general grant TfL receives from the Department for Transport.",
     "However, because of the importance of the boroughs in delivering the priorities of Mayor's Transport Strategy, the funding has been kept at a consistent level to 2013/14.",
