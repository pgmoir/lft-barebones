     "The funding has been allocated by Transport for London (TfL) through the Local Implementation Plan (LIP) process and is awarded to the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy, including safer roads, smoothing traffic flow, rejuvenating town centres and better facilities for cycling and walking.",
     "The £2.3m funding package in 2012/13 will finance a range of transport projects in Merton, including:",

These measures are in line with Merton's objective to encourage more people to cycle and are being delivered alongside the council's Biking Borough initiatives\",\"£30,000 to support funding for electric vehicle infrastructure to promote sustainable ways of travel\"]}",

     "'We've also cut bureaucracy to make it easier for the boroughs to decide how they want to spend their funding.'",
     "The LIP funds hundreds of large and small scale transport projects every year.",
     "Last year in Merton it financed 175 cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 2,983 children and 164 adults, the removal of 702 metres of guardrail, three 20 mph zones, 16 new accessible bus stops, 17 schools to participate in walking events and 12 in cycling events and 148 new street trees.",

     "The project received over £1.8m LIP Major Scheme funding for a package of traffic and public realm improvements that includes better pedestrian links to the town centre such as a diagonal crossing at the junction of Alexandra Road and St George´s Road.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy, said: 'Year on year the boroughs continue to deliver innovative projects that support the Mayor's vision for transport in the Capital.",
     "'This investment will build on the excellent work that has already been achieved and complement the huge programme of work we at TfL are undertaking to make his vision a reality through working in partnership with the boroughs.'",
     "The funding was previously forecast to reduce year on year to reflect the reduced general grant TfL receives from the Department for Transport.",
     "However, because of the importance of the boroughs in delivering the priorities of Mayor's Transport Strategy, the funding has been kept at a consistent level to 2013/14.",
