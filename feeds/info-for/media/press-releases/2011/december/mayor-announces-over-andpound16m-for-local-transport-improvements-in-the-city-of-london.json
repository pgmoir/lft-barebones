     "Last year in the City of London it financed 132 cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 101 children and 303 adults, 34 improved pedestrian crossings and 86 road safety education and training events.",
     "Notable larger projects undertaken in the City of London this year include the Chancery Lane scheme which used £1.1m LIP funding to widen footways, pedestrianise side streets and de-cluttered the environment, making it a better place for all to enjoy.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy, said: 'Year on year the boroughs continue to deliver innovative projects that support the Mayor's vision for transport in the Capital.",
     "'This investment will build on the excellent work that has already been achieved and complement the huge programme of work we at TfL are undertaking to make his vision a reality through working in partnership with the boroughs.'",
     "The funding was previously forecast to reduce year on year to reflect the reduced general grant TfL receives from the Department for Transport.",
     "However, because of the importance of the boroughs in delivering the priorities of Mayor's Transport Strategy, the funding has been kept at a consistent level to 2013/14.",
