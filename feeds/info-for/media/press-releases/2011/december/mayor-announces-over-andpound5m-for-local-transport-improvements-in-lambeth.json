As part of its plans to become the country's first cooperative council, Lambeth Council is developing a new 'community led' approach to designing transport improvements, working much more closely with residents through its 'Neighbourhood Enhancement Programme'. The LIP funding will help get this off the ground in the pilot wards of Oval, Vassall, Coldharbour, Ferndale, Larkhall and Clapham Town\",\"£550,000 to encourage more cycling in the borough, including cycle parking (both on street and residential), greenways for off-street cycling and route and junction improvements to facilitate safe cycling\",\"£110,000 for phase one of a two year project to make crossings and residential streets safe around Loughborough Junction\"]}",

     "Last year in Lambeth it financed 434 cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 1,066 children and 612 adults ,17 new accessible bus stops, 24 workplaces to participate in walking events and 36 in cycling events, three new on-street electric vehicle charging points and 42 new street trees.",

     "The funding was previously forecast to reduce year on year to reflect the reduced general grant TfL receives from the Department for Transport.",
