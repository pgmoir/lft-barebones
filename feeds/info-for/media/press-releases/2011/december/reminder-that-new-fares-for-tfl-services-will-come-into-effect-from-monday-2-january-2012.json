     "TfL today reminded Londoners that from Monday 2 January 2012 new fares for all TfL services will come into effect.",
     "Fares will rise by 5.6 per cent on average, just above inflation, which is lower than was expected after the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, secured £136m from the Government to help the Capital's commuters.",
     "This fares package will ensure that the unprecedented investment in London's transport network will continue, totalling £12bn over the Mayor's four-year term.",
     "The current investment programme includes upgrades to the Tube, now carrying a record 1.1 billion passengers a year and delivery of Crossrail.",
     "Investment is also essential for the maintenance of London's frequent, extensive, reliable and accessible bus network, which now carries almost 2.3 billion passengers a year - more than any other time since records began in the 1960s.",
     "Further extensive improvements have also been made on the Docklands Light Railway and London Overground, both of which are also experiencing record ridership. Investment is vital for the transport network to continue to develop and improve and to meet future demand, which is set to grow yet further.",
     "Isabel Dedring, Deputy Mayor for Transport, said: 'Every penny in income from fares is vital to keep services running reliably and to make improvements that will benefit Londoners at a time of record ridership on the Tube and on our buses.",
     "'The Mayor has secured an unprecedented £12bn investment in our transport network, which is backed by a fares package that keeps Transport for London's finances on an even keel with lower than had been anticipated fares thanks to the £136m he secured from the Government.'",
     "As with any fares packages, some fares will go up by slightly more than 5.6 per cent, and some slightly less.",
     "The single Oyster pay as you go bus fare will rise by just five pence, or only 3.8 per cent.",
     "The Weekly Bus Pass will rise by one pound, or 5.6 per cent.",
     "Average Tube fares will rise by six per cent.",
     "Some Tube fares in Outer London will be frozen at 2011 levels, while others - Oyster pay as you go peak zones 2-5, 3-6 and 2-6 - will rise by only four4 per cent, less than inflation.",
     "Increases to all Travelcards and Oyster pay as you go caps have also been kept down to lowest possible level, lower than first planned.",
     "The Day Peak Zone 1-4 Travelcard and cap initially planned to rise by eight per cent will now rise by six per cent and the 7 Day Zone 1-2 Travelcard has been held down from an eight per cent increase to only 5.8 per cent.",
     "All free and concessionary travel for older people, students, veterans and disabled Londoners remains protected in full, which means that 40 per cent of bus passengers will continue to travel free or at a substantial concessionary rate.",
     "The average bus fare per journey, including concessions, will be around 60p, compared to an average typical bus fare of around £1 in other UK cities.",
     "Full details of all TfL fares for 2012 are available here: \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/fares.\"\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk/fares.\u003c/a\u003e ",
