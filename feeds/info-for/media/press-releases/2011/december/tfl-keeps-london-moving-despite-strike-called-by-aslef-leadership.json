     "The completely unnecessary strike action has caused disruption, but TfL has worked hard to ensure as many services as possible have operated. Around 25 per cent of the  services scheduled for today have run. London's 700 bus routes have been in operation all day with extra buses operating in busy shopping areas and an enhanced service has been put on in the West End. The DLR has also been in operation, except between Bank/Tower Gateway and Poplar/ West India Quay due to planned engineering works and customers have also been able to use the Barclays Cycle Hire scheme, which is available across central London, as well as London Tramlink.",
     "An enhanced River service has helped move customers between Westminster and Greenwich with a central London service operating as follows: Westminster - London Eye - Embankment - Tower Pier - Westminster. City Cruises have been accepting 'London Underground ticket holders' onto the service without charge at Embankment and Tower Pier, subject to available capacity.",
     "A number of rail replacement bus services have been in place on some London Underground routes due to planned engineering works as follows:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"A Northern line replacement service has been operating between Camden Town and High Barnet/Mill Hill East, with extensions to Euston / King's Cross\",\"A District line replacement service has been operating on the Wimbledon branch with extensions to Hammersmith\",\"On the Docklands Light Railway replacement buses have operated  between Bank / Tower Gateway and Poplar / West India Quay\\u003cbr /\\u003e\"]}",
     "ASLEF called for the strike action over Tube drivers working on Boxing Day, demanding triple pay and a day off in lieu, despite a long-standing agreement which covers working on Bank Holidays including Boxing Day.",
     "Despite London Underground (LU) reducing the numbers of train staff required to work, so that only one in four are rostered to book on, the union leadership have shown themselves to be determined to strike and disrupt Londoners' Christmas holidays, shopping and sporting events. This despite the fact that only 42 per cent of balloted drivers voted for strike action.",
     "Howard Collins, LU's Chief Operating Officer, said: \"Despite this pointless strike action called by the Aslef leadership we are running more Tube services than predicted and, working with colleagues from across TfL and beyond, we are keeping London moving.",
     "\"We have made every effort to resolve this issue, including reducing the number of drivers needed to work Boxing Day so that only one in four are rostered to work. However the ASLEF leadership are intent on tearing up long-standing agreements that cover pay and annual leave and demanding even more - triple time and another day off.  Their actions demonstrate a complete disregard for our customers and for the many thousands of Tube staff who have not been on strike and have been working hard to help people get around the capital.",
     "\"We are operating a service on most Tube lines, including key lines serving the West End, supported by London's 700 bus routes and extra buses. However, the strike is causing  disruption and we would urge customers to check the TfL website and local TV and radio bulletins for up-to-date travel information.\"",
     "Although there are some services on most lines that were scheduled to operate, some have had only a limited service and some sections have been closed. Customers are urged to check before they travel at www.tfl.gov.uk.   Services operating as at 16.00pm this afternoon are as follows:",
