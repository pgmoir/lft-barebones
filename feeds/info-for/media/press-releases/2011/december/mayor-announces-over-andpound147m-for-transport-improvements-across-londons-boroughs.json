     "The Local Implementation Plan funds hundreds of large and small-scale transport projects every year.",
     "Last year it financed the removal of 7,000 metres of guardrail, cycle training for more than 40,000 children and 8,000 adults, around 6,000 new cycle parking spaces and 7,800 new street trees.",
     "Notable projects completed this year include:",

     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy said, 'Year on year the boroughs continue to deliver innovative projects that support the Mayor's vision for transport in the capital.",
     "'This investment will build on the excellent work that has already been achieved and complement the huge programme of work we at TfL are undertaking to make his vision a reality through working in partnership with the boroughs.'",
     "The funding was previously forecast to reduce year on year to reflect the reduced general grant TfL receives from the Department for Transport.",
