     "Every London borough is receiving money that will directly benefit communities, making London an even better place to live and work.",
     "The funding has been allocated by Transport for London (TfL) through the Local Implementation Plan (LIP) process and is awarded to the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy, including safer roads, smoothing traffic flow, rejuvenating town centres and better facilities for cycling and walking.",
     "The £5.8m funding package in 2012/13 will finance a range of transport projects in Croydon, including:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"£1.153m for traffic and public realm improvements in Southbridge Road and South End\",\"£241,000 for traffic and streetscape improvements around East Croydon station; this will be complemented by the Mayor's £23m funding  for wider recovery measures for Croydon after the public disturbances in August\",\"£155,000 for continued traffic and public realm improvements to Addiscombe local shopping street\"]}",
     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'London is undergoing a neo-Victorian level of investment in its transport network.",
     "'Every London borough is receiving money that will directly benefit communities, making London an even better place to live and work.",
     "'We've also cut bureaucracy to make it easier for the boroughs to decide how they want to spend their funding.'",
     "The LIP funds hundreds of large and small scale transport projects every year.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Regeneration\"}",
     "Last year in Croydon it financed cycle training for 827 children and 209 adults, road safety education training for 37,000 children, 11 new off-street electric vehicle charging points, four new on-street car club bays and 60 new street trees.",
     "Notable larger projects undertaken in Croydon this year include the regeneration of Purley Town Centre.",
     "A total of £1.8m LIP funding has been used to make public realm improvements, including new footways, lighting, seating and crossing points.",
     "Access to Purley Rail station has also been enhanced, with better interchange with bus services and additional cycle parking.",
     "The aim is to revitalise this local shopping centre and encourage further regeneration going forward.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Consistent funding\"}",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy, said: 'Year on year the boroughs continue to deliver innovative projects that support the Mayor's vision for transport in the capital.",
     "'This investment will build on the excellent work that has already been achieved and complements the huge programme of work we at TfL are undertaking to make his vision a reality through working in partnership with the boroughs.'",
     "The funding was previously forecast to reduce year-on-year to reflect the reduced general grant TfL receives from the Department for Transport.",
     "However, because of the importance of the boroughs in delivering the priorities of Mayor's Transport Strategy, the funding has been kept at a consistent level to 2013/14.",
