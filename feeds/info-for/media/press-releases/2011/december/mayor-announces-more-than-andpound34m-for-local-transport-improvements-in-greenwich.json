     "The funding has been allocated by Transport for London (TfL) through the Local Implementation Plan (LIP) process and is awarded to the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy, including safer roads, smoothing traffic flow, rejuvenating town centres and better facilities for cycling and walking.",

     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: 'London is undergoing a neo-Victorian level of investment in its transport network.",
     "'Every London borough is receiving money that will directly benefit communities, making London an even better place to live and work.",
     "'We've also cut bureaucracy to make it easier for the boroughs to decide how they want to spend their funding.'",
     "The LIP funds hundreds of large- and small-scale transport projects every year.",
     "Last year in Greenwich it financed 86 cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 740 children and 271 adults, six new accessible bus stops, 144 workplaces to participate in walking events and 144 in cycling events, ten new on-street electric vehicle charging points and 91 new street trees.",
     "Notable larger projects undertaken in Greenwich include the Woolwich Town Centre Scheme which involved upgrading General Gordon Square using £2m LIP funding as part of the Mayor's Great Outdoors programme.",
     "This comprised the renewal Beresford Square and General Gordon Square, including landscaping, the introduction of shared surfaces and upgraded lighting and paving.",
     "This has also provided improved access to Woolwich Arsenal station.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy said: 'Year on year the boroughs continue to deliver innovative projects that support the Mayor's vision for transport in the Capital.",
     "'This investment will build on the excellent work that has already been achieved and complement the huge programme of work we at TfL are undertaking to make his vision a reality through working in partnership with the boroughs.'",
     "The funding was previously forecast to reduce year on year to reflect the reduced general grant TfL receives from the Department for Transport.",
     "However, because of the importance of the boroughs in delivering the priorities of Mayor's Transport Strategy, the funding has been kept at a consistent level to 2013/14.",

Together they set out the Mayor of London's vision for improving public spaces in London.  This will ensure that our streets, squares, parks and green and water spaces are fit for a great world city, are enjoyed by everyone who visits them and most importantly, help improve the quality of life in the Capital. They are accompanied by an implementation plan that will see £355m invested in over 80 public realm improvement projects between 2009 and 2012 Games, funding for which comes from Transport for London, The London Development Agency and London's boroughs as well as other sources. The measures include redesigned streets, which can be shared by both the pedestrians and vehicles and reclaimed derelict green spaces and underused waterways. The manifesto and guides have been written and produced by the Greater London Authority, London Development Agency, Design for London and TfL. For further information please go to \\u003ca href=\\\"http://www.london.gov.uk/greatoutdoors\\\"\\u003ewww.london.gov.uk/greatoutdoors\\u003c/a\\u003e \\u003cbr /\\u003e\"]}"
