     "Train companies continue to look for ways to make Oyster easier to use.",
     "To ensure that passengers are charged the correct amount and to avoid paying the maximum fare, they must always touch in and out at the start of every journey, using Oyster validators or gates at rail stations.",
     "Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, said: 'Getting Oyster on National Rail has made a radical difference to people living in Outer London, many of who depend on overground rail to get around.",
     "'I am pleased that the train operating companies worked with us to introduce this and it is fantastic that so many people have taken advantage of being able to travel around London, hopping between Tube, bus, river or rail with just a swipe of their trusty Oyster card.'",
     "Shashi Verma, TfL's Director of Fares \u0026 Ticketing, said: 'With Oyster you only need one ticket to travel on public transport across the Capital and with seven million cards in regular use it is the world's most successful and popular travel smartcard.",
     "'It is great to see how quickly and easily commuters on National Rail services have switched to using Oyster pay as you go.",

     "'An added bonus for many passengers is that they save money too.",
     "'It was a project which took huge amounts of joint work by train companies, TfL and DfT [Department for Transport], so the scale of its success 12 months on is great news for all concerned.'",
     "The highest switch from National Rail paper tickets to Oyster has been at suburban stations such as East Croydon, Watford Junction, Twickenham, Romford, Kingston and Bromley South, where between 15,000 and 45,000 journeys are recorded each day using Oyster.",
     "'Smaller suburban stations are also recording high Oyster use, including Blackheath (14,000 journeys a day), Southall (12,000 journeys), Herne Hill (11,000 journeys), Rainham Essex (7,800 journeys), Alexandra Palace (6,600 journeys) and Sidcup (6,400 journeys).",
