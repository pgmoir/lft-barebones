     "Northern line won't stop at Tottenham Court Road station from April to November to enable major structural works on platforms.",
     "The transformation of two of the Capital's busiest Tube stations is moving into a new phase as work intensifies to completely rebuild Tottenham Court Road and Bond Street stations.",
     "Both sets of works, which are part of the Tube Upgrade Programme, will require some changes to transport services in the area.",
     "When complete, the works at the stations will mean a dramatic increase in capacity for passengers, with larger ticket halls, new entrances and escalators, step-free access and direct links to Crossrail.",
     "To enable the Bond Street station upgrade to get underway, Oxford Street will be closed eastbound between Duke Street and Vere Street for utility works from 14 February for nine months and several bus routes will be on diversion.",
     "From April, for eight months, the Northern line won't stop at Tottenham Court Road station so that major structural works can take place in the platform tunnels.",
     "The Central line will continue to serve the station as normal.",
     "London Underground's Strategy \u0026 Commercial Director, Richard Parry, said: 'The huge increase in capacity these station upgrades will bring will enhance Oxford Street's status as a world class shopping area by providing a fantastic gateway to the West End.",
     "'With the upgrade of the Northern, Victoria and Jubilee lines, and with Crossrail services set to begin in 2018, it's vital that we get these works well under way.",
     "'We've been working with high street retailers, businesses and residents to do all we can to minimise disruption and would ask Londoners to bear with us as we deliver these huge projects, it will be worth it.'",
     "Richard Dickinson, Chief Executive of New West End Company which represents retailers and property owners in Bond Street, Oxford Street and Regent Street said: 'TfL has worked closely with us on the closure plans for Oxford Street, which will of course cause a certain amount of disruption, but we're focussed on the long-term benefits it will bring to West End retailers and shoppers.",
     "'A large majority of our shoppers rely on Bond Street station and without this upgrade and vital Crossrail link, businesses would suffer from a Tube station unable to cope with the huge increase in passenger numbers.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Bond Street\"}",
     "Bond Street station is used by 155,000 people a day and can no longer comfortably handle that many passengers.",

     "The station upgrade will become more visible this year as demolition of the building at 354-358 Oxford Street will commence.",
     "This will enable the major redevelopment of the station which will include an interchange with the new Crossrail station.",
     "Significant tunnelling and excavation works will be required for both London Underground and Crossrail in this area which may lead to some ground movement.",
     "In order to ensure the safety and reliability of gas and water mains during the works and into the future, some pipes need to be strengthened or replaced.",
     "So that this can happen, Oxford Street will be closed to eastbound traffic between Duke Street and Vere Street from 14 February for nine months and traffic will be diverted via other routes.",
     "Some bus routes will be diverted via nearby Wigmore Street.",
     "Extensive traffic modelling has been done to ensure diversions take the least disruptive routes.",
     "While there will be some disruption and congestion at times, TfL will be monitoring the situation closely to assess the impact and keep the West End moving.",
     "Information for the travelling public will be placed on all bus stops affected by the diversion.",
     "Leaflets will be handed out in the days before the change, and will also be available at nearby Tube stations.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Tottenham Court Road\"}",
     "Tottenham Court Road station is more than 100 years old and was not designed to be used by the 147,000 people that currently pass through it every day.",
     "With the arrival of Crossrail, it's expected that number will grow to 200,000.",
     "To cope with that increase the station upgrade project will:",

     "The next key stage of the project involves major structural alterations on the Northern line platforms so that new routes cab be built to the platforms from the ticket hall.",
     "To enable this work to go ahead, Northern line services will not stop at Tottenham Court Road from April 2011 for eight months.",
     "Central line services at the station will run as normal.",
     "Passengers wishing to use the Northern line are advised to use nearby Goodge Street or Leicester Square.",
     "Notification of the platform closure will be given to passengers using Tottenham Court Road station well in advance and alternative travel options made clear.",
