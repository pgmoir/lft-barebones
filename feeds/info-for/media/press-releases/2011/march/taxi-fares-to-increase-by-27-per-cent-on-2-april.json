     "The fare increase aims to provide a balance between maintaining income for drivers, who face disproportionately high work-related costs compared to other Londoners, while ensuring passengers still get a fair price for the high quality and unique service provided by the Capital's taxi drivers.",
     "Taxi fares are reviewed annually and calculated by TfL based on a cost index that has been used since 1981.",
     "The process included consultation by TfL with the taxi trade and others, including London TravelWatch and the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry.",
     "The 2.7 per cent fare increase for the next financial year takes into account a number of factors including a 12 per cent increase in fuel costs and a two per cent increase in average national earnings.",
