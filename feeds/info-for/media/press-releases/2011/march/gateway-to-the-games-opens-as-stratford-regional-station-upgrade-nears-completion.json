     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"TfL will be the official lead on transport operations during the London 2012 Games. This will incorporate the road networks as well as all public transport. A number of major transport projects have already been completed or are nearing completion, leaving a legacy for the Capital well ahead of the London 2012 Games. Improvements include upgrades to London Overground and the walking and cycling networks, extensions to the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), smoothing traffic flow on the Capital's roads and increasing capacity on the Tube. The Tube is undergoing a huge and essential programme to upgrade its ageing infrastructure - vital to cope with a growing population and to support the economic development and growth of the capital and the UK. This includes the introduction of new track and signalling and the rebuilding of some of our most important stations. By the end of the current programme in 2020 there will be 30 per cent more capacity\",\"This will inevitably result in some disruption for passengers, but TfL is working hard to provide information and alternative travel options. The work is essential to provide for London's growing transport needs now, and into the future. TfL is urging all Londoners and Tube, London Overground, London Tramlink and DLR passengers to 'check before you travel' at weekends, allowing extra journey time where necessary. Weekend travel news is available at \\u003ca href=\\\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk\\\"\\u003etfl.gov.uk\\u003c/a\\u003e \",\"Platform 3a on the Central line was brought into use in September 2010. The new ticket hall at Straford will provide direct access to this platform which has a special design allowing customers to get off westbound trains from both sides of the carriage. This makes it easier for customers to change onto other lines or leave this busy station more quickly\\u003cbr /\\u003e\"]}"
