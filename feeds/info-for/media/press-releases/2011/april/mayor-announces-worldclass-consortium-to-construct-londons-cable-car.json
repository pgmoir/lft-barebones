The strategy proposes a package of improvements including a new fixed link at Silvertown and an upgraded ferry service in the longer term\",\"A public consultation found that an overwhelming majority of the public have given the Mayor of London's plans for a cable car the thumbs up, 89 per cent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the cable car 'would be an exciting new feature for London' while 85 per cent agreed or strongly agreed that it 'would be a valuable addition to transport options available, particularly when large events are on'. More than 1,000 people took part in TfL's public consultation, 83 per cent of whom either lived and/or worked in the Docklands area\",\"Planning consents for the cable car are now in place from Newham and Greenwich Councils, the Thames Gateway Corporation and the Greater London Authority\",\"Stretching 1.1km across the River Thames and with 34 gondola cabins operating, the cable car will have the capacity to carry up to 2,500 people per hour and it is anticipated two million passengers per year\",\"The cable car will be fully accessible and will be designed so it can be used by those with reduced mobility including wheelchair users and people with pushchairs; in addition bicycles will be allowed onto the link\",\"In addition to regeneration the cable car could bring a number of additional benefits including:\",\"Cutting journey times between the Greenwich Peninsula and Royal Docks\",\"Increase transport capacity and provide an alternative for local journeys in the area\",\"Improve resilience in the transport network, something much needed in this area\",\"Attract new visitors to east London with spectacular views along the Thames from the cabins\",\"Provide a low-emission mode of public transport allowing the river to be crossed with no impact on air quality\",\"There are three other cable cars in the UK, including the Nevis Range in Scotland and the Heights of Abraham in Derbyshire but these are mainly used as tourist attractions. Mass transport links similar to London's cable car can be found in Barcelona, Lisbon, New York and Singapore\",\"Options for crossing the river east of Tower Bridge have improved significantly in recent years with the opening of the Jubilee line extension, the expansion of the DLR network, the introduction of passenger ferry services and the recently reopened East London line. The opening of Crossrail in 2017 will provide new links but further improvements are required particularly for vehicle travel across the river. The Mayor asked TfL to investigate a package of river crossing options across east London to address a number of problems. TfL published its initial report in July 2009 with options outlined in the 2010 Mayor's Transport Strategy which recommends the following the package of measures:\",\"A new road crossing at Silvertown would be better placed to relieve south and east London of the congestion at Blackwall and provide the resilience that is needed\",\"An upgraded Woolwich Ferry\",\"Consideration of a new vehicle ferry service at Gallions Reach\",\"Improvement of local links for pedestrians and cyclists\",\"Consideration of a long term link at Gallions Reach\",\"Encourage of modal shift from private cars to public transport\"]}"
