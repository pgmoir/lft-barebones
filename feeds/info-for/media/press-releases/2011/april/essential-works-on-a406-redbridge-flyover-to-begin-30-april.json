     "During this work, we will ensure that disruption for road users and local residents is kept to a minimum and will be working to complete these works as quickly as possible.",
     "Routine safety inspections of the Redbridge flyover established that the four expansion joints - which allow the flyover to expand or contract due to movement of the bridge - need replacing for safety reasons.",
     "The work will take place on one direction of the A406 at a time, beginning with the northbound direction, followed by the southbound. A contra-flow system for light vehicles will operate across the flyover in the other lanes.",
     "This will allow traffic to continue using the flyover while this vital work is carried out.",
     "Traffic will also be able to use the roundabout underneath the flyover to pass through the area.",
     "The eastbound bus routes which serve Redbridge Station will need to use a new temporary bus stop on the eastbound A12 Eastern Avenue just beyond the station, except for route 366 which uses the station forecourt as part of its route, and will continue to do so.",
     "In agreement with the London Borough of Redbridge, louder works will be carried out Monday to Friday between 08:00 and 18:00, and on Saturdays between 08:00 and 14:00.",
     "Quieter works will take place outside the above hours and all works are scheduled to be completed within approximately three weeks.",
     "Dana Skelley, Director of Roads for TfL said: \"This essential work to replace the A406 Redbridge Flyover expansion joints is vital to ensure that the structure can remain open to traffic.",
     "\"During this work, we will ensure that disruption for road users and local residents is kept to a minimum and will be working to complete these works as quickly as possible.\"",
     "All of the works require heavy machinery but TfL will do everything possible to keep disruption to residents to a minimum and keep the public informed of road diversions and how the project is progressing.",
     "Clear diversion signs will be in place on main approach roads throughout the works and publicity for bus diversions will also be posted at local stops and on the TfL website.",
