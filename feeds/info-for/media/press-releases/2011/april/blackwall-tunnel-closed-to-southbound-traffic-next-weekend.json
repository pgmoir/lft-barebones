     "This will allow Transport for London's (TfL's) contractor, BAM Nuttall, to continue vital upgrade works as well as resurfacing the entire 1.4km tunnel, neither of which can be carried out during the weeknight closure programme.",

This measure was used during previous weekend closures last year and resulted in considerably less congestion overall\",\"Drivers who would usually use the Rotherhithe or Blackwall Tunnel will also be able to use alternative river crossings such as Southwark Bridge, London Bridge and Tower Bridge or the Dartford Crossing to complete their journey.\",\"The Woolwich Ferry will also be operating a two-boat service across the Easter weekend (22, 23 and 25 April, 06:10-22:00; 24 April 09:00-21:30).\"]}",

     "Work completed so far includes the installation of new ventilation fans in the tunnel's four shafts as well as new lighting, upgraded CCTV and new communication systems installed throughout the tunnel.",

Because the diversion involves chicanes, a 20mph speed limit is put in place each night and enforced by average speed cameras.
