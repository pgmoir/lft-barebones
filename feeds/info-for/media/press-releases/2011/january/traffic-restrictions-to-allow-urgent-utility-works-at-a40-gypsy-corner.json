     "To reduce disruption, TfL has insisted that, where feasible, National Grid work 24-hours-a-day to complete repairs as quickly as possible.",
     "These works have been scheduled to be carried out at the least disruptive time, with traffic flows along the A40 Gypsy Corner being lower during the last weeks of January than later in the year.",
     "In order to help minimise future disruption, TfL will also be carrying out essential highway maintenance during these restrictions.",
     "Due to the works, a number of lane restrictions will be put in place along the A40 between Victoria Road and Wales Farm Road.",

     "However, two lanes of traffic will be maintained in both directions.",
     "No right turns will be allowed out of Wales Farm Road and Horn Lane, and the speed limit throughout the work area will also be reduced from 40mph to 20mph to allow the works to be carried out safely.",
     "Throughout the works, TfL will monitor traffic flows along the A40 and the surrounding road network to ensure that any disruption is kept to a minimum.",
     "Variable messaging signs will be placed along the road and traffic signal timings will be altered during the works to smooth traffic flow through the area.",
     "Alan Bristow, TfL's Traffic Director, said: 'TfL has liaised with National Grid to coordinate these urgent repair works to ensure that they are carried out with minimum disruption to drivers on the A40.",
     "'Through collaborative working, TfL has also managed to coordinate other works to take place at the same time, reducing the need for further closures in this area in the future.",
     "'National Grid have agreed to work 24-hours-a-day, where feasible, to complete these essential repairs as quickly as possible and we ask motorists to bear with us while these repair works are carried out.'",
     "National Grid Network Engineer Tony Smith said: 'By coordinating our work with TfL, we can ensure that any disruption caused by the work is got out of the way in one fell swoop.",
     "'We apologise for any inconvenience people do experience as a result of our work.",

These measures alone have helped reduce disruption from poorly planned and coordinated works\",\"The Mayor and TfL continue to work with the Department for Transport on introducing a lane rental scheme.
