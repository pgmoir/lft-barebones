     "Companies have been invited to submit proposals to supply the new trams which, subject to funding being confirmed, would increase the frequency of services on the busiest route which runs between central Croydon and Elmers End.",
     "Kulveer Ranger, the Mayor of London's Transport Advisor, said: 'Our tram network offers a vital service to south Londoners and we want to make it even easier for passengers to get on board by boosting the frequency of services.",
     "'Ever increasing numbers are using the trams and this will help improve their access to jobs, education and leisure facilities in the south of the Capital.'",
     "Chief Operating Officer for TfL London Rail, Howard Smith said: 'We are pleased to be working with the London Borough of Croydon to try and boost capacity on the London Tramlink network.",
     "'Since we took over the network in 2008, we have been improving the service and looking at ways to make it even better.",
     "'With the number of journeys increasing by 45 per cent since it opened in 2000 we want to respond to the demand and ensure that London Tramlink continues to provide people in south London with a comfortable and efficient means of getting around.'",
     "The London Borough of Croydon is intending to be able to contribute to the cost of the trams.",
     "Croydon Council Leader Mike Fisher said:Â  'This is looking like a great deal for Croydon and shows the benefits of an ambitious local authority and committed Mayor working together, pooling resources and expertise.",
     "'Although we are still to take a final Cabinet decision on our contribution, we believe that there will be real support to get additional trams for Croydon to keep pace with growing demand for Tramlink services and also to secure major improvements for pedestrians and transport users around and between East and West Croydon stations.",
     "'Mayor Johnson recognises that extra trams will provide an early answer to capacity issues.'",
