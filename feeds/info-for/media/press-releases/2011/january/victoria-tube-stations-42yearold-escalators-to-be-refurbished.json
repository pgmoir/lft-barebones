     "The station is undergoing a £700m investment to redevelop it to cope with an increasing number of passengers.",
     "The works are essential as passenger numbers at the station - one of London's busiest - are expected to rise from the current 80 million a year to nearly 100 million a year by 2016.",
     "The refurbishment is timed to be complete before the 2012 Olympic and Paralympics Games, which will also increase demand.",

     "All measures will be taken to limit disruption to passengers using the station while this essential work takes place but passengers are being asked to plan their journeys and take alternative routes where possible; especially those entering the station during the evening rush hour.",
     "The three escalators which run down from the main ticket hall to the Victoria line platforms will be out of service one at a time while they are being worked on.",
     "More passengers leave the station in the evening rush hour so the two working escalators will have to be in the 'up' position in the evening peaks in order to clear the platforms as quickly and safely as possible.",

     "It will be easier and quicker for passengers to use a nearby station rather than enter Victoria Tube station in the evening between 16:00 and 20:00 because it may take up to 15 minutes to reach the platforms and passengers may also have to wait outside the station to prevent overcrowding.",

     "'If passengers do use this station they should top up their Oyster cards or buy their tickets beforehand.",
