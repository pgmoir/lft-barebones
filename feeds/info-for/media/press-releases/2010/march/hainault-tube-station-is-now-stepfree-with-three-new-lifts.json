     "A new accessible toilet has been installed that will be useful for wheelchair users and new tactile strips with tonal contrast on steps will aid visually impaired people.",
     "The first thing passengers will notice on entering the station will be a new electronic display board informing them of the first trains leaving the station, so they will know how many minutes they have got to get to the platform. In addition there is a new control room, new CCTV cameras, new electronic train information boards on platforms, passenger help points and improved signage.",
     "Kulveer Ranger, the Mayor of London's transport advisor, said: 'Hainault is a cracking example of the improvements the Mayor wants to see in our Tube stations, particularly those in outer London.
