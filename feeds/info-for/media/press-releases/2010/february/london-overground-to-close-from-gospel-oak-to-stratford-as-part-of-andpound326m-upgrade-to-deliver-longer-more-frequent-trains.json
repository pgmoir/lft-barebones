     "Between Saturday 20 February and 1 June 2010 major signalling and track renewal work, platform lengthening and the refurbishment of some stations will mean there will be no service between Gospel Oak and Stratford stations.",
     "A rail replacement service will provide buses every 20 minutes six days a week. On Sundays this will reduce to two buses an hour.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"More frequent services\"}",
     "London Overground has also set up a system that will allow many passengers to travel at no extra cost by Tube or National Rail services through Zone 1, providing they travel from a Tube or National Rail station near their usual London Overground station.",
     "Passengers should check their eligibility by picking up a pamphlet at one of the stations or contact the Oyster Help Desk on 0845 330 9876.",
     "When the complete upgrade is finished in 2011, London Overground will run more frequent services with longer trains.",
     "Services from Richmond and Clapham Junction to Stratford will run four times per hour all day every day and there will be six trains per hour between Willesden Junction and Camden Road and eight trains per hour in the peak between Camden Road and Stratford.",
     "Ian Brown, the Managing Director of TfL London Rail, said: 'We apologise to passengers for this inconvenience and are doing all we can to minimise the disruption caused.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Turn-up-and-go service\"}",
     "'This was one of the most neglected railways in the UK when we took it over two years ago and these are essential works that will help us unlock the true potential of the London Overground network, which is to offer a far more frequent Metro-style turn-up-and-go service.",
     "'We have to close this part of the line for this amount of time because of the nature of the work.",
     "'Large amounts of material will have to be moved around for the signalling and track upgrades, which means if we were to restrict the work to weekends and then have to restore the railway to working order each Monday morning, the disruption would be over a much longer period.'",
     "The improvement work is part of an upgrade that will see more than 200 signals, seven kilometres of track and 69 sets of points improved and 30 station platforms lengthened.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Growing demand\"}",
     "Passengers are being urged to always check before they travel during the closure and to take, if at all possible, alternative transport such as Tubes and replacement buses.",
     "Andrew Munden, Route Director for Network Rail, said: 'The investment being made in the North London line is an integral part of Network Rail's plans to improve services and build a bigger and better railway in the Capital.",
     "'The project will provide vital additional capacity for the Olympic Games and help meet growing demand on the line, which is expected to rise by a quarter in the next seven years.'",
     "The suspension of the Gospel Oak to Stratford services will mean that not all of the trains from Richmond and Clapham Junction will be able to run through to Gospel Oak but will have to stop at Willesden Junction to take advantage of the turnaround facilities there.",
     "In the morning and evening peak two trains per hour from Clapham Junction and two trains per hour from Richmond will carry on to Gospel Oak, while the other one train per hour from Richmond and one train per hour from Clapham Junction will terminate and start at Willesden Junction.",
     "There will also be one extra train during the busiest hour of the peak between Willesden Junction and Richmond. The off peak service times remain unaffected.",
