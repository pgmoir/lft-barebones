This represents a 10-15 per cent time saving for bus passengers depending on which section of the route they are travelling along\",\"ELT will operate as two routes - EL1 and EL2. Both routes will operate between Ilford Hill and Thames View Estate, with EL2 continuing on to Dagenham Dock station. EL1 operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, while EL2 operates between 05:15 and 00:30 seven days a week\",\"ELT has replaced route 369 which operated between Ilford High Road and Thames View Estate. Route 179 (Chingford station - Ilford - Barking) will now terminate at Ilford.

It is supported by two practical guides, 'Better Streets' and 'Better Green and Water Spaces'. Together they set out the Mayor of London's vision for improving public spaces in London. This will ensure that our streets, squares, parks and green and water spaces are fit for a great world city, are enjoyed by everyone who visits them and most importantly, help improve the quality of life in the Capital\",\"They are accompanied by an implementation plan that will see £220m invested in more than 50 public realm improvement projects over the next three years, funding for which comes from TfL, The London Development Agency and London's boroughs as well as other sources. The measures include redesigned streets, which can be shared by both the pedestrians and vehicles and reclaimed derelict green spaces and underused waterways\",\"The manifesto and guides have been written and produced by the Greater London Authority (GLA), London Development Agency, Design for London and TfL. For more information visit the \\u003ca href=\\\"http://www.london.gov.uk/greatoutdoors\\\"\\u003eGLA website\\u003c/a\\u003e \"]}"
