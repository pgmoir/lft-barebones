     "This is great news for not only our customers and the local community but also for our staff who take care of the station",
     "Bounds Green Tube station has been awarded Grade II listed status by English Heritage.",
     "This status will ensure that the Holden-style station is recognised as a unique and outstanding example of modernist design to be enjoyed by the many thousands of people using this Piccadilly line station every day.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Modernist style\"}",
     "Recent refurbishment work by Transport for London has conserved the station's historical features.",
     "These include the octagonal ticket hall, unique amongst London Underground stations, which is lit by four large windows with an imposing lattice of concrete beams in the ceiling; large London Underground roundels; and original bronze signs, ventilation grilles and information panel frames.",
     "The station was built as part of the first section of the northward extension of the Piccadilly Line to Cockfosters which opened in sections during 1932 and 1933 to serve the growing suburban areas of north Middlesex.",
     "The construction and design of the station were overseen by Frank Pick (1878-1941) and Charles Holden (1875-1960) who are both regarded as instrumental in creating London Underground's identity and brand.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Balanced design\"}",
     "Holden's designs emphasised functionality combined with balanced geometry and the use of modern materials, especially glass and reinforced concrete.",
     "The historical significance of the station is emphasised by its involvement in the World War II blitz.",
     "On 13th October 1940 the north end of the westbound platform was badly damaged by a German bomb which killed 19 people and wounded many others sheltering in the station.  A plaque commemorating this tragedy was erected in the station in 1994.",
     "Phil O'Hare, General Manager for the Piccadilly Line at London Underground, said: 'This is great news for not only our customers and the local community but also for our staff who take care of the station.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Identity of the Underground\"}",
     "'Heritage is a huge part of London Underground's identity and I am sure our staff, who are passionate about the history of their station, will be very proud that it now has heritage status.",
     "'London Underground is undertaking a major programme of renewal as part of TfL's multi-billion pound Investment Programme. This will lead to a more frequent, comfortable service, but will not be at the expense of maintaining the Tube's unique historical features.'",
     "Mike Ashworth, Design and Heritage Manager of London Underground, said: 'Bounds Green and other stations on the Piccadilly Line are stunning examples of how the Underground was built to provide not only an efficient mode of transport, but also to promote new suburban development, making stations the focal points of local high streets.",
     "'Stations built 80 years ago, such as Bounds Green, still live up to these expectations, reinforcing and enhancing London Underground's brand and identity.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Restoring heritage features\"}",
     "Emily Gee, Heritage Protection Team Leader at English Heritage, said: 'English Heritage welcomes the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport's decision to list Bounds Green Station at grade II on our advice.",
     "'This station has special architectural interest for its bold Modernist style and impressive octagonal ticket hall.",
     "'We are also pleased to have a positive partnership with London Underground, with whom we share an understanding of the special stations in their care.",
     "'Listing recognises these distinctive stars of London's modern heritage while enabling their continued use as working infrastructure.'",
     "Bounds Green station was refurbished in 2007 as part of TfL's upgrade work on the London Underground.",
     "This work involved the restoration of heritage features and included the upgrading of CCTV cameras, retiling and decorating the station, repairs to the roof and exterior, platform resurfacing and the installation of Help Points.",
