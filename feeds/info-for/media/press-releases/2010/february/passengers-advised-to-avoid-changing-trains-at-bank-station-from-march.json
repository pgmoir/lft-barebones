     "The improvements to the escalators are critical in making sure that Bank and Monument stations can continue to operate",
     "Four escalators are being replaced or upgraded as part of TfL's multi-billion pound Investment Programme.",
     "Nigel Holness, the Service Director for Bakerloo, Central, Victoria and Sub-surface lines, said: 'We are urging passengers to plan their journeys to avoid changing trains at Bank and to use alternative stations nearby wherever possible, such as Cannon Street, Moorgate, Mansion House, London Bridge, Liverpool Street, or St. Paul's.",

     "'The improvements to the escalators are critical in making sure that Bank and Monument stations can continue to operate and serve the increasing number of passengers.",
     "'Regular passengers will know that work has already been carried out to some escalators at these stations to ensure their long term reliability, including the complete replacement of the escalators in Monument station.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Easier and quicker\"}",
     "'More reliable escalators mean reduced congestion, faster journey times and quicker interchange times at Bank and Monument.'",
     "Between March 1 and the end of the year, one of the escalators running between the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) platforms and Northern/Central lines will be replaced.",
     "There will be no step-free lift access between the DLR platforms and street level during this work.",
     "Passengers who intend to travel on the DLR or who are coming from the DLR platforms will find it easier and quicker to enter and leave via Monument station.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Keep congestion to a minimum\"}",
     "Between the start of May and the end of 2011, the three escalators running to and from the Central line ticket hall will be taken out of service for refurbishment work one at a time.",
     "A one-way system will operate during the morning peak when the majority of passengers using the Central line are leaving Bank station.",
     "In order to clear the platforms and keep congestion to a minimum the two working escalators will be run in the up direction so that customers will be able to leave as usual from the Central line ticket hall.",
     "This means that anyone coming into Bank Station during the morning peak hours between 07:00 and 10:00 Monday to Fridays, wanting to get a Central line train should enter via the Northern line ticket hall and follow the signs to get to the Central line platforms.",
