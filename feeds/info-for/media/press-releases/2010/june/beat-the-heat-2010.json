     "Customers on the London Overground network are already benefiting from a fleet of 42 fully air-conditioned trains, including all 20 on the new East London line route.",
     "By the end of the year a total of 54 air-conditioned trains will be operating, giving passengers cooler journeys through the 20 boroughs currently served by the railway.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe Metropolitan line will become the first London Underground (LU) line to get a fleet of air-conditioned trains, starting with the first train this summer.",

     "New trains will then be rolled out onto the Circle, District and Hammersmith \u0026 City lines over the next five years.",
     "Work is progressing to cool the Victoria line, with the capacity of the fans at all of the main ventilation shafts serving the line being doubled.",
     "Four fans were completed last year and the second phase of the upgrade will be completed this summer.",
     "Industrial-sized blue fans are also being deployed to help cool 30 locations across the Tube network.",
     "Kulveer Ranger, the Mayor of London's transport advisor, said: 'As a regular Tube user I know how uncomfortable and frustrating it can get when the temperature rises.",
     "'It will be cold comfort for those using warmer lines but this summer we will see a significant roll out of trains with air conditioning on the Overground lines and the first air-conditioned Tube train.",

     "There are now 3,488 double-deck buses with air cooling or forced air ventilation systems, an increase of 58 per cent on last year.",
     "TfL has also been working with the bus operators and joint funding a scheme to retrofit automatic heating systems on 1,367 of the older double-deck buses in the fleet to ensure heating is not left on during the hot summer period.",
     "Of the 8,500 buses in the fleet 6,356 have white roof panels which help to reflect the heat.",
     "New buses must have insulated roof and side panels which reflect heat along with tinted side glass.",

     "'Air cooling systems are now fitted on all new double deck buses joining the fleet now have it installed.",
     "'Additional opening windows have also now been fitted on all double deck buses.'",

The groundwater trial provides an environmentally friendly cooling solution for the Victoria line platforms at Victoria station and uses groundwater which is already pumped out of the station. Across the Tube network, LU pumps out 30 million litres of water each day\",\"Ventilation shafts - LU is upgrading ventilation shafts, which will improve airflow- increasing air distribution capacity to allow hot air to escape more easily. Over the next few years, plans are underway to upgrade 13 ventilation fans along the Victoria line, the first four are working now, more will be completed this year, and all will be finished in 2011\",\"Out-of-service fans - LU is working to re-condition and upgrade the existing station ventilation fan network. A total of 83 ventilation fans have now been restored, more than doubling the capacity of the fan network and this year works are about to start at Old Street, Angel and Notting Hill Gate\",\"Portable fans - In 2008 fans installed within tickets and concourse areas, to increase air circulation at a number of stations. A total of 30 fans will be in service again this summer\",\"Mechanical Chiller units - A mechanical chiller which provides cooling to customers and staff in the ticket hall area have now been installed at Oxford Circus and Euston stations. Work to cool platform areas at Victoria, Green Park and Oxford Circus will be complete 2012-15\",\"Impulse fans - LU has installed ceiling mounted impulse fans on Bakerloo line platforms at Marylebone and Lambeth North stations\"]}",
