     "'It's encouraging to see that the Mayor's investment in additional visible transport policing and the combined efforts of the Safer Transport Command have had such a positive effect on bus crime and in return on the travelling experience of Londoners.'",
     "Deputy Mayor for Policing Kit Malthouse said: 'It's not rocket science - Boris's recruitment of 440 additional police officers to manage bus hubs has resulted in 2,000 fewer crimes.",
