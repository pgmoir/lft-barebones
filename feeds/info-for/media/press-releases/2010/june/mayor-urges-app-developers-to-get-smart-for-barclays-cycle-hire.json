     "In build up to the launch of the Mayor's Barclays Cycle Hire scheme on 30 July, Transport for London (TfL) has relaxed its terms and conditions to allow commercial use of official data - opening the door for developers to provide accurate and reliable information about the hundreds of locations where hire cycles will be available, smart routes around town or proximity of docking stations to Tube stations and places of interest.",

     "As part of the Mayor's vision for London as a cycle city six-thousand cycles will be available at around 400 locations across central London, which is expected to generate up to 40,000 extra daily cycle trips a day.",
     "Users can pay £1 for 24-hour access, £5 for seven-day access, or take out a £45 annual Membership.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Cycle revolution\"}",
     "Subsequently, each completed journey of up to half an hour will be free of charge.",
