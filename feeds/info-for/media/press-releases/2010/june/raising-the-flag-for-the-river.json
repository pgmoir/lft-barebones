     "These improvements will make the river easy to navigate and make it a truly integrated part of London's public transport network",
     "Getting around London using the Thames will be plain sailing thanks to a package of improvements announced by the Mayor and Transport for London (TfL) today.",
     "The improvements aim to make life easier for the six million passengers who use the river each year and open it up to thousands of new users.",
     "London's oldest thoroughfare is being brought into the 21st century with realtime information to show when the next boat arrives now available at most piers, online or through a new iPhone application.",
     "A 'Tube style' service map has also been released today that makes it much easier for passengers to work out which boats go to which piers.",
     "It is also being made easier to identify which piers operate commuter services and which run cruises for sightseers looking for a leisurely tour along the river.",
     "To make things clearer river services will now be identified using a simple flag system with commuter services becoming River Buses, and sight-seeing leisure services becoming River Tours.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Plain sailing\"}",
     "The first of the banner style flags, which will also be illuminated at night, was unveiled at Blackfriars pier today and the scheme will be rolled out to all TfL piers across the summer alongside new signs at stations and on the streets.",
     "Commuters are also benefiting from being able to surf the web with 15 minutes free internet access via Wi-Fi at every pier between Millbank and Greenwich, and on a number of river services.",
     "Kulveer Ranger, the Mayor of London's Transport Adviser, said: 'Travelling by river is one of the great joys of life in the capital, which is why we want to make it as easy as possible for Londoners and visitors to our capital.",
     "'Our piers have been crying out for a simple system that shows which services stop at them and where they go.",
     "'With the new flags, maps and realtime information it has never been easier to catch a boat in London.'",
     "Mike Weston, Surface Transport's Operations Director, TfL, said: 'The Thames runs through the heart of the city and is used by six million commuters and visitors every year.",

     "'These improvements will make the river easy to navigate and make it a truly integrated part of London's public transport network.'",
     "Londoners using the river should also have the opportunity to look out for the host of famous names who have used the river to get around the capital.",
     "Nicholas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni used the Thames on their last state visit to the UK, as has a plethora of world class entertainers that have graced The O2 including the Rolling Stones, Neil Diamond, Kylie Minogue and Bon Jovi who are currently in residence at The O2.",
     "To find out more about the changes and to take advantage of a number of special offers giving passenger cheap travel fares over the next month, visit TfL's \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/river \"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e or pick up one of the new widely-available leaflets which provide clear information on services and routes.",
     "Port of London Authority chairman, Helen Alexander, said: 'The river gives commuters and visitors a unique perspective on London.",
     "'We are really pleased to be bringing our experience of the whole of the tidal Thames and its estuary to bear, supporting the Mayor, his transport team and the boat operators as they work to open up this fantastic experience to as many people as possible.'",
