     "The 2009 road casualty figures found that 301 teenagers (aged 13-19) were killed or seriously injured (KSI) on London's roads last year, compared with 367 in 2008.",
     "Overall the number of teenagers killed or seriously injured has fallen by almost 55 per cent since 2000.",
     "The message for teenagers to look out for their mates will be heavily promoted across the Capital this summer.",
     "For eight weeks, messages will be online, on the radio and in the Capital's parks.",
     "Teenagers are more likely to be involved in a road accident than any other age group in the Capital.",
     "This is partly because of their growing independence, with many young people travelling to secondary school and spending more time with their friends.",

     "Kulveer Ranger, the Mayor of London's Transport Adviser, said: 'For the numbers to be going in the right direction year on year proves we are doing something right.",
     "'But the grim fact is that 17 teenagers died on London's roads last year, and 284 others were seriously injured.",
     "That is 301 casualties too many and means we cannot afford to be complacent.",
     "It is absolutely vital that we build on the progress we have made, which is why TfL and the Mayor will continue to do all they can to make sure that teenagers in London take road safety seriously.'",
     "Lilli Matson, Head of Modal Policy, Better Routes and Places at TfL, said: 'Although our work is far from done, these statistics show that the teen road safety campaign really is making a difference.",
     "'This summer we look forward to continuing this good work.'",
     "The teen road safety campaign is part of a long-term TfL road safety campaign that works to reduce the number of young road users who are killed or are seriously injured in the Capital.",
