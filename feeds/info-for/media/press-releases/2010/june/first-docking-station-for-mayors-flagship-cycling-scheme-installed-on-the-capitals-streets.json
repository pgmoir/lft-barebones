It has 33 docking points. Photos of the installation (including time lapse photography) are available from TfL's press office on 0845 604 4141\",\"An additional four test docking stations will be installed in Southwark and Lambeth at the following locations: two on Stamford Street (opposite Paris Gardens, and junction of Cornwall Road), Union Street (opposite Ewer Street), and another on Southwark Street (close to the junction with Borough High Street).

This means that there will be a docking station every 300metres or so\",\"TfL has worked closely with the nine London boroughs and several Royal Parks that Barclays Cycle Hire will cover to identify the most suitable locations for docking stations, with all applications subject to planning consent and including a period of consultation. The boroughs, as the planning authorities, have been making the final decision on whether to approve the locations\",\"In order to maximise the chance of people being able to return a bicycle to the docking station of their choice, there will be approximately 1.7 bicycle docking points for each bicycle. This means that, once the scheme is complete, there will be 10,200 docking points spread across 400 docking stations.
