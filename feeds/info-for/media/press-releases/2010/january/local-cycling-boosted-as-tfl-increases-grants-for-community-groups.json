     "We are encouraging new recruits to the Mayor's Cycle Revolution and we are here to help local communities turn their ideas into actions",
     "Transport for London (TfL) is calling for Londoners and organisations passionate about cycling to submit applications for grants to help promote cycling activities in their communities.",
     "And there's an extra boost this year as in addition to grants of up to £5,000, grants of £10,000 are available for particularly outstanding projects.",
     "There are two rounds of funding when applications can be submitted; the first round is open from 18 January until 5 February 2010 and applicants who miss this deadline will have another chance to apply when the second round opens on 8 March until 26 March 2010.",

     "The fund, administered for TfL by the London Cycling Campaign (LCC), assists the development of projects that encourage people to cycle and to make cycling an everyday activity that is open to all Londoners.",
     "It seeks to support those projects that build the confidence of infrequent or new cyclists from all types of backgrounds - especially groups such as women, children and young people, ethnic groups and disabled people.",
     "Ben Plowden, Director of Integrated Programme Delivery at TfL said: 'We are encouraging new recruits to the Mayor's Cycle Revolution and we are here to help local communities turn their ideas into actions to promote pedal power.",
     "'This year, we're offering increased grants to give local cycling champions the opportunity to think bigger and offer better opportunities to get more people cycling and people cycling more often.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Building confidence\"}",
     "Community groups from across London have already benefitted from the Fund which has made a real impact upon people from all walks of life.",
     "They include the STA Bikes and Wilton Estate project in Hackney who received £4,824 to provide adults and children with cycle training and for cycle maintenance workshops for young people in the youth centre.",
     "Located in the heart of Hackney, the estate is fast becoming a cycling estate working with others to encourage and promote cycling in the local area.",
     "Barnet Norwood Centre and Barnet Mencap project 'Get on Your Bike' was another of the groups to received funding, with £4,990 to help them encourage cycling for adults with learning disabilities in their community.",
     "London Cycling Campaign Community Cycling Officer Rosie Tharp said: 'Through the grants awarded in 2009, over 3,000 people have benefitted, with many building their cycling confidence while others gained cycle maintenance skills.",
     "'A total of 191 abandoned bikes were put back into action and 55 cycle-rides were organised, all thanks to funding from TfL.",
     "'We look forward to receiving many applications again this year and urge all community groups in outer London boroughs that are currently underrepresented, to take this opportunity to get cycling.'",
     "For more details on the CCFfL grant criteria, visit the \u003ca title=\"LCC website\"href=\"http://www.lcc.org.uk/community\"\u003eLCC website\u003c/a\u003e .",
