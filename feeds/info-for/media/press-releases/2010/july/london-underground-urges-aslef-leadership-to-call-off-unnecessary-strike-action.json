     "LU believes that the dispute is actually over a driver from Rickmansworth depot who has been temporarily re-graded after a safety related incident.",
     "LU will endeavour to run the best possible service, however, customers are advised to check before they travel by visiting \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk\"\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e ",

     "'We are at a loss to know what has led to the strike other than a disciplinary case of one driver who has been temporarily re-graded followingÂ an incident in which his failure to follow safety procedures led to a customer being injured.",
     "'We will not compromise on safety, and we would urge ASLEF to call off this completely unnecessary strike action immediately.'",
     "During the course of any strike action LU will be operating a special timetable, which will be advertised at stations.",
     "Services on other lines, such as the Jubilee and Piccadilly, will be increased wherever possible, and LU has worked closely with National Rail providers to ensure they are prepared for additional passengers."
