     "However, the independent report found that some questions remain about the way in which motorcycle riders use bus lanes.",

     "Ben Plowden, Director of Better Routes and Places at Transport for London (TfL), said: 'As part of this new trial, we'll be introducing a focused road safety awareness campaign aimed at making drivers more aware of the need to look out for motorcyclists' and cyclists' presence in bus lanes.",
