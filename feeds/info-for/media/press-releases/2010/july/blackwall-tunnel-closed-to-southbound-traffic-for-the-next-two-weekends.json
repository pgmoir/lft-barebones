     "The Blackwall Tunnel will be closed to southbound traffic for the next two weekends as part of the ongoing refurbishment and safety upgrade of the 113 year old tunnel.",
     "This will allow Transport for London's (TfL's) contractor, BAM Nuttall, to carry out vital improvement works to the tunnel that can't be carried out during the weeknight closure programme.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Traffic disruption\"}",
     "During the last weekend closure of the southbound Blackwall Tunnel (4-7 June), many parts of east London experienced severe traffic congestion.",
     "The main cause was the volume of traffic attempting to head south of the river via the Rotherhithe Tunnel. As the tunnel normally only has one southbound lane, this led to delays and frustration for drivers.",
     "As a result, the Rotherhithe Tunnel will only carry southbound traffic during the weekend closures of the Blackwall Tunnel.",
     "This will allow traffic heading south across the river to use both lanes of the Rotherhithe Tunnel, reducing the amount of disruption that these works will cause.",
     "Northbound drivers who would usually use the Rotherhithe Tunnel will be able to use the Blackwall Tunnel (which has two northbound lanes open), as well as alternative river crossings such as Tower Bridge, the Woolwich Ferry or the Dartford Crossing.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Woolwich Ferry\"}",
     "The Woolwich Ferry will also run additional services between 06.10 and 22.00 on Saturday and 09.00 and 21.30 on Sunday to help reduce congestion and provide an alternative river crossing during the closures.",
     "Garrett Emmerson, Chief Operating Officer for London Streets, TfL, said: 'We apologise for the inconvenience these weekend closures may cause while these essential works are being carried out.",
     "'Our contractor will be working 24 hours a day to ensure that these works are completed as soon as possible.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e'We are endeavouring to provide a better balance between northbound and southbound traffic by making the Rotherhithe Tunnel operate two southbound lanes while the Blackwall Tunnel is closed.",
     "'However, given the levels of traffic congestion experienced during the last closure, we do advise drivers to avoid the area during these two weekends if at all possible.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"More closures planned\"}",
     "TfL expects to need up to 10 weekend closures during the three year Blackwall Tunnel refurbishment programme. The remaining five closures will take place in 2011 and 2012, and dates will be announced in advance of these closures as work progresses.",
     "Work on the refurbishment will be completed by December 2012. For more information, visit \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/blackwalltunnelrefurbishment\"\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk/blackwalltunnelrefurbishment\u003c/a\u003e .",

Because the diversion involves chicanes, a 20mph speed limit is put in place each night and enforced by average speed cameras.
