These improvements will make the tunnel meet the latest safety standards where appropriate and will help to ensure the safe continued use of the tunnel, which was built in 1897 and carries 50,000 vehicles a day\",\"While the refurbishment works are carried out, northbound traffic is diverted through the southbound tunnel. Because the diversion involves chicanes, a 20mph speed limit is put in place each night and enforced by average speed cameras. Southbound traffic uses other river crossings\",\"There is no toll for using the Dartford - Thurrock river crossing between 22:00 and 06:00\",\"While the northbound tunnel is closed for refurbishment works, the Route 108 (which is the only bus to use the Blackwall Tunnel) is affected.
