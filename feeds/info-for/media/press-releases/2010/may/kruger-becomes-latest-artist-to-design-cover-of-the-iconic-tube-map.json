Her training was as an advertisement designer on Condé Nast's leading fashion title Mademoiselle magazine in New York, where, within a year and at the age of only 22, she was promoted to chief designer. In 1980 she had her first solo exhibition at P.S. 1, Long Island City, New York. In 2005 Kruger received the \\\"Golden Lion\\\" for Lifetime Achievement at the 51st Venice Biennale and she is currently professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Kruger recently had a solo exhibition at Mary Boone Gallery which featured a new video installation entitled 'The Globe Shrinks' (2010). This was a multiple channel video installation in which we saw Kruger's ongoing engagement with the innate contradictions of direct address and the unspoken, as well as the interplay of pictures and words. 'The Globe Shrinks' will be exhibited at Sprüth Magers Berlin next year. Barbara Kruger's work also features in the group show Beg, Borrow and Steal at The Rubell Family Collection, Miami (until 29 May)\",\"London Underground (LU) is undertaking a major programme of renewal as part of Transport for London's Investment Programme. This will inevitably result in some disruption for passengers, but TfL is working hard to provide information and alternative travel options. The work is essential to provide for London's growing transport needs now, and into the future. TfL is urging all Londoners and Tube, London Overground and DLR passengers to 'check before you travel' at weekends, allowing extra journey time where necessary.
