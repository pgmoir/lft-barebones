     "Young Londoners are being encouraged to enjoy the rest of their summer holidays to the full by signing up to Transport for London's (TfL) Zip Oyster photocard scheme.",
     "The scheme permits eligible young people to travel for free on buses and trams in the Capital - freeing up their wallets for summer fun. It also gives 11-15 year-olds child-rate travel on the Tube, DLR and London Overground, with a daily cap of just £1 (Zones 1-6).",

     "This scheme gives young people the chance to make the most of living in London, whatever their economic background, and is something which more than half a million young Londoners have already benefitted from.",
     "Kulveer Ranger, the Mayor of London's Transport Advisor, said: 'With the rest of the summer holidays ahead of them, the Zip card allows young Londoners to explore all that our Capital has to offer without making a big dent in their spending money. However in order to access this scheme parents and their kids need to make sure that they have applied and I urge them to do so.'",
     "Steve Burton, TfL's Director of Community Safety, Enforcement and Policing, said: 'The Zip scheme is a privilege, which young Londoners should make the most of and appreciate.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Touch in and out\"}",
     "'They should adhere to the Behaviour Code, treating other passengers with respect. It's also important they remember to always touch in when boarding buses and trams, and touching in and out on Tube, DLR and London Overground journeys.",
     "'Summer can be an expensive time for families as young people have so much free time to fill during the holidays. I hope that all parents and young people in London are aware of the benefits of the Zip Oyster photocard scheme and that they remember to sign up for it.'",
     "Zip Oyster photocard application forms are available from Post Offices within London.",
     "It may take up to two weeks to process applications. 11-15 year olds who do not have a valid Zip Oyster photocard must pay the cash fare on buses and trams. Proof of application will not be accepted by bus drivers as a valid ticket for travel.",
