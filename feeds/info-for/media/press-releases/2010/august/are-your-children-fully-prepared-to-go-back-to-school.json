     "I urge all parents to make sure that their children sign up to the Zip card scheme as it a great benefit for young people in London.",
     "With the new school term looming, Transport for London (TfL) is reminding parents to make sure their children have a Zip Oyster photocard ready for the school journey.",
     "The Zip Oyster photocard scheme gives all 5-15 year olds, and eligible 16-19 year olds, free or concessionary travel on London's buses and trams and is an invaluable tool for students across the Capital.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Huge savings\"}",
     "At a time of year when parents are feeling the financial strain of a new school term, the Zip Oyster photocard scheme helps them to make huge savings on transport costs.",
     "Many of London's parents have already made sure their children are taking advantage of the scheme and TfL is keen to encourage more to do so.",
     "As well as free travel on buses and trams, the card also gives 11-15 year old Oyster photocard holders child-rate travel on the Tube, DLR, London Overground and National Rail, with a daily off-peak cap of just £1 (Zones 1-9). 16-18 year olds pay half adult rate when using pay as you go on bus, Tube, tram and some National Rail services, with some qualifying for free travel on buses and trams.",
     "Kulveer Ranger, the Mayor of London's transport advisor, said: 'Parents may be busy checking bags are packed and new shoes are bought but they shouldn't forget the Zip Oyster photocard.",
     "'It is undoubtedly one of the most important accessories for any student in London. A lot of children use public transport to get to school so this fantastic scheme really can help ease the financial burden on parents.",
     "'I know that there are a lot of things to think about in the run up to the autumn term. However to get this privilege parents need to fill in the application forms so I would encourage them to put this at the top of their 'to do' list.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Behaviour Code\"}",
     "Steve Burton, TfL's Director of Community Safety, Enforcement and Policing, said: 'I urge all parents to make sure that their children sign up to the Zip card scheme as it a great benefit for young people in London.",
     "'All Zip card holders must sign up to and follow the Behaviour Code which helps improve the travelling experience for all passengers.'",
     "The scheme allows all photocard holders across the city to travel easily to and from school and explore the Capital no matter where they live in London.",
     "Zip Oyster photocard application forms are available from Post Offices within London. Applications for the 16+ Oyster photocard will be accepted at Post Offices and are available from 1 September. Applications must be submitted by 17 September to ensure that young people receive their new 16+ Oyster photocards by 30 September. 5-10 and 11-15 Oyster photocard applications can be made at any time.",
     "It may take up to two weeks to process an application. 11-18 year olds who do not have a valid Oyster photocard must pay the £2.00 cash fare on buses and trams. Proof of application will not be accepted by bus drivers as a valid ticket for travel.",
     "In July, TfL announced that from 1 September 2010 a non-refundable £10 administration fee will be payable for all new applications for Zip Oyster photocards. The £10 charge has been introduced to contribute to TfL's administration costs of the concessionary schemes, including processing application forms, photocard production and postage.",
