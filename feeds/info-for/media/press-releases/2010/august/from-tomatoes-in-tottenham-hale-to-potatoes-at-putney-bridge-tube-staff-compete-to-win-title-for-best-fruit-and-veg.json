     "London Underground's (LU's) annual gardening competition 'Underground in Bloom' is under way and as well as tending plants and flowers, this year a fruit and vegetables category had been added.",
     "In total 55 Tube stations, depots and service control rooms across the network have risen to the challenge of creating a beautiful oasis in an urban environment.",
     "Acton Town for example has used rubble left over from the station upgrade work to create a garden.",
     "These green spaces are currently being judged by a panel of LU judges until 3 September.",
     "The Underground in Bloom awards aim to recognise Tube staff who have gone beyond the call of duty by making stations more attractive in their own time.",
     "The new edible food category is in support of the Mayor's Capital Growth programme which encourages organisations and communities to grow their own produce.",
     "Categories include cultivated garden plots, hanging baskets, tubs, fruit and vegetables and a new art category called Gardens in Bloom.",
     "Extra points are given to environmentally friendly gardens that attract wildlife or are water wise.",
     "Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, said: 'A great pat on the back for all those dedicated Tube staff who have tended hanging baskets, cultivated fruit and veg and watered blooms, all in their spare time to make their stations more colourful.",
     "'It also goes to show you can grow your own fruit and veg just about anywhere.'",
     "Howard Collins, Chief Operating Officer for LU, said: 'Once again I have been really impressed by the effort and time that our staff have put into transforming the Tube into a brighter and more attractive place.",
     "'These wonderful gardens, hanging baskets and tubs have all been cared for in our hardworking employees' own time.",
     "'This shows just how committed our staff is to offering an outstanding service to customers using the London Underground.'",
     "Winners will be announced on 16 September at City Hall.",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"LU is undertaking a major programme of renewal as part of Transport for London's (TfL)'s Investment Programme. This will inevitably result in some disruption for passengers, but TfL is working hard to provide information and alternative travel options. The work is essential to provide for London's growing transport needs now, and into the future. TfL is urging all Londoners and Tube, London Overground and Docklands Light Railway passengers to 'check before you travel' at weekends, allowing extra journey time where necessary.

Developed and managed by London Food Link, part of Sustain, it now has more than 537 spaces already being cultivated across the Capital in a diverse range of places including schools and canal banks, roofs, and private gardens open to the community and parks.
