     "On Friday 24 September, a convoy of 100 London taxis left Canary Wharf, taking children suffering from life-threatening illnesses on the trip of a lifetime to Disneyland Paris.",
     "Excitement levels grew throughout the morning as the Lord Mayor of the City of London, Alderman Nick Anstee, cut the ribbon to mark the start of the trip.",
     "The escorted convoy, which was around five miles long, headed off towards Dover at 08:30.",
     "Since the trip began in 1994, around 3,500 sick children have enjoyed the annual Children's Magical Taxi Tour, organised by the Worshipful Company of Hackney Carriage Drivers.",
     "Transport for London's (TfL's) Director of Taxi \u0026 Private Hire, John Mason, said: 'Yet again London's taxi drivers show why they are famous the world over by giving up their time to provide this fantastic opportunity for children and their carers to visit Disneyland Paris.",
     "'As always, we are delighted to be able to support this event which has brought so much joy to thousands of children.",
     "'We hope everyone involved has a fun and truly memorable experience.'",
     "The Children's Magical Taxi Tour is paid for entirely by sponsorship and fundraising, the taxi drivers have given up their time and their vehicles without charge.",
     "'All of the vehicles were liveried with advertising and sponsors' details, clearly marking them as part of the convoy.",
     "Travelling with the convoy were City of London and Metropolitan Police escorts, London Ambulance NHS Trust vehicles, a group of AA breakdown trucks to help out if there are any mechanical problems en route, and a contingency from the Gendarmarie Nationale, who are responsible for public safety in France.",
