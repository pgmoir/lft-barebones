     "The District line will now run a service between Ealing Broadway and High Street Kensington during the evening peak, and the Piccadilly line will serve Heathrow 123 from Acton Town.",
     "Ahead of the strike, TSSA union Gerry Doherty leader predicted that London would be 'paralysed' by the strike.",

     "'The RMT and TSSA leaderships have chosen to disrupt Londoners for no good reason.",
     "'The safety argument they deployed - which has never been raised in any formal forum - is completely without foundation.",
     "'It is simple scaremongering designed to mask their wish to strike.",
     "'Londoners will doubtless find it incredible that the two union leaderships have pursued this action when they have been given cast-iron assurances that the staffing changes we are making come with no compulsory redundancies, that every station that currently has a ticket office will retain one, and that every station will remain staffed at all times.'",

The quietest ticket offices include North Ealing, which sells under six tickets per hour, and Latimer Road and Moor Park, which sell only around seven tickets per hour\",\"Overall, sales from ticket offices are down 28 per cent over the last four years as more and more people switch to Oyster, just one in 20 Tube journeys now starts with a visit to a ticket office\",\"Under LU's proposals staff will be more effectively deployed to areas of stations where they can better assist customers, removing duplication of roles whilst delivering the best possible value for fare and taxpayers\",\"The proposed changes would mean a reduction in the total number of posts across LU, but will involve no compulsory redundancies, and will have no impact on the Tube's high safety standards\",\"The changes would not affect Tube drivers, and the majority of the roughly 800 posts that are identified for reduction are ticket office staff; this also includes a saving of around 150 posts from reductions in management and administrative staff. This is out of a total of around 19,000 LU staff, so represents less than five per cent of the workforce. Some 250 positions are already, or are expected to become vacant, so these would merely not be filled\\u003cbr /\\u003e\"]}"
