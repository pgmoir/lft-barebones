It was proposed to rectify this error in 2009/10 by adding 0.4 per cent for one year only to fares, however at the time stakeholders agreed that it would be inappropriate given the financial downturn. It was proposed again as part of the 2010/11 fares review to include the 0.4 per cent increase for one year only, and driver associations have now supported its inclusion\"]}",
