     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, today confirmed that, from January 2011, fares on London's Tubes, buses, London Overground, Docklands Light Railway and trams will rise only by the level signalled last year, the minimum to secure investment in London's transport network and protect frontline services.",
     "All free and concessionary travel for older people, the young, the poorest and disabled Londoners has also been protected in full.",
     "From 2 January, 2011, fares on Transport for London's (TfL's) services will rise by an average of RPI plus two per cent, the assumption outlined by the Mayor when TfL published its most recent \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/investorrelations/1462.aspx\"\u003eBusiness Plan \u003c/a\u003e in October 2009.",
     "Based on July's RPI figures of 4.8 per cent, this represents an average 6.8 per cent fare increase across TfL services and Oyster pay as you go.",
     "The Mayor's decision on fares comes following tough negotiations over TfL's future finances as part of the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review, which saw TfL's overall grant funding from the Department for Transport (DfT) reduced by £2.17bn in total over four years, or 21 per cent in real terms in 2014/15, when compared to the base year of 2010/11.",
     "However, as DfT funding is around one third of TfL's total funding, this represents less than eight per cent of TfL's planned expenditure on capital investment (excluding Crossrail) and frontline services.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Transport priorities\"}",

     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: 'Last year, I made it clear that when setting fares my priority is to protect the elderly, the young, the poorest and disabled Londoners and this fares package will continue to do so, particularly at a time when many need that protection.",

     "'I'm also pleased that I am able to confirm an average fares increase at the level we declared it would be last year, the absolute minimum required to secure vital investment in London's transport network and protect frontline services.",

     "This 'contra flow' system reflects available capacity on these Tube journeys at this time.",
     "On London's buses, the Oyster pay as you go fare will only go up by 10p to £1.30.",
