     "An Football Association spokesperson said: 'Football has the amazing capacity to capture people's attention, and when such serious matters are at stake it is important to harness that capability and do what we can to make a difference.'",
     "'Young footballers have an important role to play with so many of their peers looking up to them.",
     "'I'm confident this campaign will make a difference.'",
     "John McDermott, Tottenham Hotspur's Academy Manager, said: 'Most teenagers don't spend a lot of time thinking about road safety but it really is something which they should give a little more thought to.'",
     "'After hearing the shocking statistic that nearly every day a teenager is killed or seriously injured on London's roads our lads were really keen to do what they could to help.",
     "'That's why they're reaching out to their peers to remind them to 'look out for their mates' on the roads now that it's getting darker earlier.",

Each person volunteered their services for free\",\"In March 2000 the Government announced in 'Tomorrow's roads - safer for everyone' a national road safety strategy and casualty reduction targets. The casualty reduction targets, compared with the 1994/98 baseline, are to be achieved by the end of 2010. They are:\",\"A 40 per cent reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured\",\"A 50 per cent reduction in the number of children killed or seriously injured\",\"A 10 per cent reduction in the slight casualty rate\",\"In addition, a Road Safety Plan for London was produced by TfL in 2001. The plan supported the national targets and set further targets for reducing the numbers of pedestrians, pedal cyclists and powered two-wheeler riders killed or seriously injured by 2010 when compared with the 1994/98 baseline. TfL announced new, more stringent targets in March 2006, again to be achieved by 2010. Currently the Mayor's targets for London are as follows:\",\"A 50 per cent reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured\",\"A 50 per cent reduction in the number of pedestrians killed or seriously injured\",\"A 50 per cent reduction in the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured\",\"A 40 per cent reduction in the number of powered two wheeler users killed or seriously injured\",\"A 60 per cent reduction in the number of children killed or seriously injured\",\"A 25 per cent reduction in the slight casualty rate\",\"London has already exceeded the 2010 targets set by the Government for the number of children killed or seriously injured and the total number of people killed or seriously injured three years early. London has also met the more stringent London target of a 60 per cent reduction in the number of children (age 15 and younger) killed or seriously injured on our roads and is working to further reduce the number of casualties\",\"The \\u003ca href=\\\"http://londonroadsafety.tfl.gov.uk/data-research_publications.php \\\"\\u003eCasualties in Greater London during 2009 report \\u003c/a\\u003e is available online\\u003cbr /\\u003e\"]}"
