However, an independent report found that some questions remain about the way in which motorcycle riders use bus lanes. It identified that there was an increase in the rate of motorcyclist collisions, predominantly with cars turning into or out of side roads on routes where motorcyclists had access to bus lanes. At the Trial sites there was an increase from 30 to 41 collisions, whereas there was a reduction from 16 to eight collisions on the Control sites. In light of those findings, the decision was made to introduce the current Trial, which started on 24 July 2010 and which will run for 18 months\",\"The number of motorcycle and scooter riders killed or seriously injured on London's roads fell by four per cent (738 to 706) in 2009, compared to 2008 and by 24 per cent since the mid to late 1990s\",\"The previous Motorcycles in Bus Lanes Trial ran from 5 January 2009 to 5 July 2010. View the TRL monitoring report of the trial \\u003ca title=\\\"Motorcycles in bus lanes\\\"href=\\\"/roadusers/redroutes/10151.aspx\\\"\\u003eAssessment of TfL's experimental scheme to allow motorcycles onto with-flow bus lanes on the TLRN\\u003c/a\\u003e .
