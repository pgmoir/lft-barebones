     "Lee was named the winner by the Mayor's Transport Adviser, Kulveer Ranger, at a special event as part of the international Bicycle Film Festival on Saturday evening.",
     "His quirky short film, Simon and Simone, serves to remind us all that love can conquer all - with the help of the Mayor's flagship cycle hire scheme!",
     "Lee, from Kilburn, said: 'We wanted to make a film which was simple, engaging and also showed how useful and accessible the Cycle Hire scheme is.",
     "'We recorded the film in one afternoon traversing London from the Barbican to the South Bank to try and get as many iconic locations in as possible.",
     "'What we came up with is an old fashioned race against time, with the Barclays Cycle Hire bike saving the day and bringing two estranged lovers finally together.'",
     "Kulveer Ranger, the Mayor of London's Transport Adviser, said: 'Some absolutely fantastic films were put together for the competition and each of them captured the energy and excitement that the Mayor's cycling revolution is generating in the Capital.",
     "'But congratulations go to Lee for his superb piece of work.",

     "'The films served as a wonderful advertisement for cycling in our city.'",
     "Adrian Wootton, Chief Executive of Film London said: 'Short film-making is widely regarded as the best way for aspiring film-makers to learn their trade.",
     "'It is fantastic for Film London to find partners, such as TfL, to offer a film making competition which provides another platform to Londoners to get out there and make short films.",
     "'Also it is wonderful to be celebrating cycling through film making as London is undergoing an exciting cycling revolution.'",
     "The competition was launched to coincide with the arrival in the Capital of the Mayor's flagship cycle schemes, Barclays Cycle Hire and Barclays Cycle Superhighways.",
     "In just ten weeks since the launch of Barclays Cycle Hire more than 90,000 members have made over a million journeys between them, boosting cycle journeys in the Capital by around 20,000 journeys every week day.",
     "Barclays Cycle Superhighways benefits London's cyclists by making it safer and easier to commute by bike between outer and inner London.",
     "The first two pilot routes - Barking to Tower Gateway and Merton to the City - were opened in July and early results suggest there has been an overall increase of 25 per cent in cycle journeys, with some sections of the Merton to City route showing increases of 90 per cent or more.",
     "The shortlisted films can be viewed on request.",
