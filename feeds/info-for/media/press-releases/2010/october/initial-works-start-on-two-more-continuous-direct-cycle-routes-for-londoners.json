Proposals also include upgrading the traffic signal equipment, and assessing the possible removal of existing left-turn slip roads\",\"Providing a quicker and safer way for cyclists to travel across the Bow Roundabout on the Bow to Aldgate route\",\"Introducing a clearly marked diversionary route so that cyclists can avoid the busy junction of Battersea Park Road and Queenstown Road on the Wandsworth to Westminster route\",\"Introducing mandatory cycle lanes wherever possible, including along 25 per cent of the Wandsworth to Westminster route\"]}",
