     "These include a frequent service from Embankment to Woolwich Arsenal. Using the River Bus has never been easier with Oyster pay as you go now available on Thames Clippers services.",
     "As well as using the river to get from a to b, river tours are a great way to relax and see the city from another angle. The updated River Tour Guide gives details of fun events and tours on the river.",
     "Snack while you sail with a lunch or dinner cruise or maybe a Sunday Lunch Jazz Cruise. Those who want something a bit different can enjoy a 'who dunnit' with the River Thames Murder Tour or dance the night away on one of the Riverboat Disco party boats.",
     "Kulveer Ranger, the Mayor of London's transport advisor, said: 'Travelling by river is one of the joys of living in the Capital; and the Mayor's vision is for it to be an integral part of London's transport network.",
     "'We are committed to making it easier for Londoners and visitors to make the most of the unique experience of travelling along the Thames and it is great to see passenger numbers increasing all the time.'",

     "Passengers with a valid Travelcard, or an Oyster card loaded with a valid Travelcard, can get a third off single fares on most river services.",
     "On Thames Clippers the cost of the journey can be taken from any Oyster pay as you go balance. Passengers with Oyster pay as you go get 10 per cent off the normal Thames Clipper adult fare.",
     "Andy Griffiths, Head of London River Services, said: 'The River Thames is fantastic throughout the year, giving visitors and residents an opportunity to see many iconic London landmarks, including the Tower of London and the Houses of Parliament, from a fantastic vantage point.",
     "'With the introduction of improved signage, clearer 'Tube style' river maps and new branding along the river bank it's never been easier to enjoy the Thames.'",
