     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Almost 95 per cent used public transport to get around during previous strikes\",\"More river and bus services will get Londoners to work\"]}",
     "The Mayor and Transport for London (TfL) have today set out the range of transport measures that will supplement Tube services to help people get around the Capital and keep London moving during the planned strike on London Underground (LU) on 28-29 November, called by the leaderships of the RMT and TSSA unions.",
     "Despite the union leaderships predicting London's 'paralysis', LU was able to consistently operate 40 per cent of its normal services during the strike on 3 November, rising to 50 per cent for large parts of the day.",
     "LU carried around half of its normal passenger numbers during that strike, and almost 95 per cent of Oyster users were able to go about their business and get around the city on public transport.",
     "If Monday's strike goes ahead, LU will once again be running as many services as possible. More than 100 extra buses, capacity for around 10,000 more journeys on the river, and marshalled taxi ranks will all help Londoners to get around the Capital.",
     "In addition, planned roadworks are being delayed or curtailed where possible, and TfL will be working to keep road traffic flowing around key transport hubs.",
     "Volunteers will again be positioned at Tube, bus, and rail stations to help Londoners with their journeys, providing maps and other useful information.",
     "Londoners who own a bike are encouraged to cycle to work and cycle parking facilities are being made easier for newcomers to access.",
     "The Cycling Journey Planner will again be available on TfL's website.",
     "The Barclays Cycle Hire scheme - which saw record usage during the last strike - will be available to members and TfL's contractors will be working to ensure that bikes are redistributed as effectively as possible. Normal services are also expected to run on London Overground, Docklands Light Railway and Tramlink.",
     "Despite ongoing talks the unions currently intend to proceed with the strike.",
     "They are threatening to disrupt Londoners despite being given assurances that staffing changes proposed by LU will have no impact on the Tube's industry-leading safety standards.",
     "The proposals will mean no compulsory redundancies and no loss of earnings, that every station that currently has a ticket office will continue to have one, and that stations will continue to be staffed.",
     "The union leaderships have been urged to reconsider their action and call off the strike.",
     "Should the strike go ahead, LU will work to operate as many services as possible, but passengers are advised that disruption is likely and that alternative travel options and staggering journey times should be considered where possible.",
     "Passengers are advised to plan ahead and check before they travel at \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk\"\u003etfl.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e ",
     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'I feel sure that the defiance and contempt Londoners have shown for the previous futile strike action will be evident once more.",
     "'The leaderships of the TSSA and RMT may well cause inconvenience through their stubborn refusal to face facts, but we are determined to keep the Capital moving by all means available to us.",
     "'London will not be beaten.'",
     "Transport Commissioner Peter Hendy said: 'London Underground has been ready and willing to discuss any safety concerns which the RMT and TSSA leaderships may have had since these proposals were announced at the start of March.",
     "'We remain willing to discuss these at any time.",
     "'The fact is that the TSSA and RMT leaderships are not facing reality, and are determined to inconvenience Londoners by striking over post reductions, many of which have already happened.",
     "'More than half of the 800 post reductions have been achieved -150 management and administrative staff have taken voluntary severance, and 300 vacant stations posts will not be filled.",
     "'When it is introduced in February the new LU staffing structure will mean every station will continue to be staffed and every station with a ticket office now will still have one.",
     "'The Tube's excellent safety standards will be maintained and not one member of staff will have faced compulsory redundancy.'",
     "Currently, RMT and TSSA members will begin their strike action at 18:30 on Sunday 28 November, and Tube services will not return to normal until the start of services on Tuesday morning, 30 November.",
     "Those public transport workers who are on duty during the strike will be doing their very best to keep London moving and passengers' patience is asked for over what may be difficult journeys.",
