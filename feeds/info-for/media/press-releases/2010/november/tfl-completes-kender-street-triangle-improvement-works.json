     "Now these works have been completed, Lewisham Council will work to improve and upgrade the inner roads within the Kender Street Triangle as part of its 'Streets for People' initiative.",
     "These works, which TfL is working with Lewisham Council to fund, will see roads within the triangle repaved and reduced to 20mph, new trees planted throughout the area and walking and cycling routes linked together to make them safer and more accessible for local residents.",
     "Lewisham Council will be holding a public consultation in December 2010 about these proposals, and is working to be on site by early 2011.",
