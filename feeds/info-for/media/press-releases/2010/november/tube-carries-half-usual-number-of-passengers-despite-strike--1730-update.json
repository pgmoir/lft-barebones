     "London Underground (LU) is operating train services on ten out of 11 lines this evening as Tube and other transport services combine to ensure that Londoners can continue to get around the Capital despite today's futile strike action called by the RMT and TSSA leaderships.",
     "Analysis of Oyster data shows that the Tube has carried half the usual number of passengers despite the strike.",
     "LU has operated half of its usual number of trains for large parts of the day, and intends to maintain up to 40 per cent of services during this evening.",
     "More than three-quarters of stations are currently open.",
     "The Waterloo \u0026 City, Northern, Victoria and Metropolitan lines are all now running services from end to end, and the majority of the Jubilee and District lines are also being served.",

     "Good services are operating on the bus network, Docklands Light Railway (DLR), and London Overground.",
     "Extra bus services have been provided, along with extra capacity for an additional 10,000 journeys on river services, and marshalled taxi ranks.",
     "Volunteers are on hand at bus, Tube, and rail stations to help passengers and distribute walking maps and other useful information.",
     "LU was able to operate more than 40 per cent of its normal services during the last strike and carried 50 per cent of its normal passenger levels.",
     "Almost 95 per cent of all usual Oyster journeys were also undertaken across London's transport network.",
     "Mike Brown, Managing Director of LU and London Rail said: 'Services are operating on virtually all lines this morning despite the pointless strike.",

     "'Our city needs a modern transport system run as efficiently as possible.",
     "'We have been consulting with the union leaderships on this for more than six months, trying to establish what specific safety concerns they may now have.",
     "'We offered a further six weeks to discuss our plans to see if there are any local issues which need to be addressed, but the leaders of the RMT and TSSA prefer to attack the people of London yet again and attempt to hold us all to ransom.",
     "'If they are serious about resolving this issue, they should immediately call off their totally unnecessary strike, which will achieve nothing whatsoever.",
     "'We will talk to them right now on any genuine safety issues they have.",
     "'We want an end to this dispute and believe that a resolution will be only achieved through talks, not by further threats to disrupt London.'",
