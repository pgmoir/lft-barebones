     "It shows the location of trains across the London Underground network at any time.",
     "It is among a raft of improvements to the new look \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/businessandpartners\"\u003eDevelopers' Area\u003c/a\u003e which includes clearer guidelines to web developers on how to use the information to create apps or other travel tools.",

     "Chris MacLeod, TfL's Director of Group Marketing, said: 'This is great news for our passengers.",
     "'We are committed to making travel information available to passengers how and when they want it.",

     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Free-to-use data\"}",
     "Michael Gilbert, TfL's Director of Technology, said: 'TfL with the help of Microsoft, has created a strategic, scalable technical platform that will aid us in making real-time data sets available, the first of which is Trackernet data.'",
