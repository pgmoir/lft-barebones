     "The Mayor of London has confirmed £146m of funding which will allow boroughs to transform town centres and revolutionise roads across the Capital.",
     "The money was allocated by Transport for London (TfL) for the London boroughs to spend on local transport improvements.",
     "It will fund local projects which support the Mayor's Transport Strategy, including improvements to local town centres and public spaces, new cycling facilities, safer roads and measures to smooth traffic flow.",
     "Today's funding announcement of £146m will mean the vast majority of the boroughs' proposed schemes for 2011/12 will be delivered.",
     "To support this, the Mayor has given greater flexibility to the boroughs so that they can prioritise projects according to local need.",
     "Following the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review, the funding allocated to London boroughs will fall over the next three years to reflect the new reduced grant TfL receives from the Department for Transport.",
     "However, the funding for programmes such as road maintenance, bridge strengthening, major schemes and the borough discretionary fund have all been safeguarded.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Local improvements\"}",
     "Funding to benefit all London boroughs is also being made available for modernising traffic signals and partnership initiatives such as completion of the London Strategic Walking Network.",
     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: 'This funding will allow the boroughs to make real improvements to town centres, provide better cycling facilities and make roads safer across the Capital.",
     "'I'm especially pleased we have been able to cut the red tape that used to surround these schemes and give the boroughs more freedom to choose how they want to spend money to improve their local communities.'",
     "The funding supports hundreds of local transport projects, including:",
