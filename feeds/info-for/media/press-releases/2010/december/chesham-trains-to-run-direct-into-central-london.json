     "At the moment, passengers travelling to and from Chesham during off peak periods have to change at Chalfont \u0026 Latimer.",
     "From Sunday, Chesham customers will have an interchange-free journey to and from London.",
     "The changes follow consultation with local residents that took place back in 2008, which found the majority in favour of the change.",

     "'By eliminating the need to change at Chalfont \u0026 Latimer, customers will have a quicker and more convenient journey in to and out of central London.",
     "'It will also mean that we are able to introduce more of the new walk-through, air-conditioned trains, which started serving part of the Metropolitan line earlier this year.",
     "'The new trains are made up of eight cars which cannot be separated and are therefore unable to serve the bay road at Chalfont \u0026 Latimer station which the Chesham shuttle, which is made up for four carriages, currently serves.",
     "'The new timetable will allow LU to run longer trains in and out of Chesham, all day, every day.'",
