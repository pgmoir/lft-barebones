     "The Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, has hailed the Prologue of the Tour de France in London a huge success after an estimated one million people packed the streets of the capital to cheer on the world's greatest cyclists.",
     "The Mayor, who dropped the flag for the first rider, said: \"The first day of the Tour de France in London has demonstrated that the capital is an unrivalled location for major international sporting events. Hundreds of thousands of spectators have enjoyed a thrilling, free day out today having seen world-class cyclists speed through the streets of London.",

     "\"The Tour de France is a superb opportunity to promote London as a cycling city. The number of people taking to two wheels has soared by 83 per cent over the last seven years.  We want the excitement of this weekend to encourage even more people to take up cycling.\"",
     "The route for the Prologue involved the riders speeding, one after the other, at one minute intervals, around some of London's best known landmarks situated around the 7.9km course.",
     "From the starting ramp in Whitehall, the riders tore past Big Ben and around Parliament Square before hurtling up Victoria Street and turning towards Buckingham Palace. From there, they headed up Constitution Hill to Hyde Park Corner, entered the park and circled the Serpentine. On exiting the park, riders negotiated a tight corner at the bottom of Park Lane before heading back down Constitution Hill before reaching the finish line on The Mall.",
     "Riders were cheered throughout by the crowds with the most noise being reserved for the final sprint towards the finish line. The fastest time of eight minutes and 50 seconds was recorded by Swiss rider Fabian Cancellara from Team CSC, who earns the right to wear the famous yellow jersey and lead the peloton out over Tower Bridge to the official start at Greenwich, as stage one of the Tour de France commences on Sunday morning.",
     "Hours before the riders sped through the streets of London, the Tour de France Publicity Caravan set off through the Prologue route to build excitement for the race.",
