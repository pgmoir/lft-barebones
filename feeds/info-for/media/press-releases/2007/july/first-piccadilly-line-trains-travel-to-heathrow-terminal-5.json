     "London Underground begins trial operations, with first passenger services due when T5 opens in March 2008.",
     "The Piccadilly line extension to Heathrow Terminal 5 celebrated a major step today, as it was handed over by BAA to London Underground to start trial operations, on time and on budget.",
     "Tube trains will now run to the station for the first time, to ensure that all aspects of the rail service can be operated safely and reliably, ahead of the first passenger services when Terminal 5 opens on 27 March 2008.",
     "The trials will also allow staff training to take place.",
     "The Piccadilly line extension to Heathrow Terminal 5 is the first on the Tube network since the extension of the Jubilee line to Stratford in 1999.",
     "1.7km tunnels had to be constructed to carry the extended Piccadilly line to the site of the new Terminal 5.",
     "Ken Livingstone, Mayor of London, said: \"This is a major milestone in the delivery of the new Piccadilly Line extension to Heathrow Terminal 5.",
     "\"From March 2008, passengers will benefit from faster, more frequent services on the line along with increased capacity.",
     "\"This improved service will underline that public transport is the sensible choice for travel to and from Heathrow airport.\"",
     "Mike Challis, Piccadilly line General Manager, said: \"The extension of the Piccadilly line to Heathrow Terminal 5 is a key project.",
     "\"We will now test the trains to ensure they are ready for the opening of T5 in March next year.",
     "\"Once Heathrow T5 opens, a new service on the Piccadilly line will provide direct journeys to passengers between Heathrow T123 and Heathrow T5, bypassing Heathrow T4, whilst the service to Heathrow T4 will remain unchanged.",
     "\"Looking to the future, the Piccadilly line will be upgraded by 2014 as part of Transport for London's £10bn Investment Programme.",
     "\"The upgrade will provide the line with a new signal control system, new trains and a new Line Control Centre.\"",
     "Ian Fugeman, BAA Head of Rail and Tunnels said: \"Seeing Tube trains inside the Terminal 5 station is hugely satisfying; it is the culmination of many years of hard work and successful project management by BAA.",
     "\"I am delighted to have worked in partnership with London Underground, Tube Lines and our many other consultants and contractors to deliver this rail extension which is an integral part of the public transport strategy for Terminal 5.\"",
     "Ian Copeland, Director of Projects from Tube Lines said: \"The signalling system for the new part of the Piccadilly line was a complex project involving extensive integration work at Earl's Court, Hatton Cross and the new part of the line, including additional capacity in London Underground's control room.",
     "\"Tube Lines was able to complete the bulk of the physical work in a short window after construction works were completed through meticulous planning, installing state-of-the-art equipment and using a sophisticated simulator which meant that testing and training were quicker. This integrated and innovative approach helped us deliver our work on time and below budget.\"",
