     "London Buses introduced six single-deck hybrid buses into the fleet in March 2006 and a double deck hybrid bus was launched by the Mayor of London in March 2007.",
     "This was the first double-deck hybrid bus to enter public service in the world.",
     "The buses are easily identified with their distinctive leafy design.",
     "The GreenFleet Awards recognise organisations in the transport industry for their environmental best practice efforts and innovations.",
     "The winners were announced at an event at the East Wintergarden, Docklands on Thursday 6 September.",
     "Ken Livingstone said: \"This award recognises our ongoing commitment to a cleaner, greener public transport network in order to improve air quality and tackle climate change. We hope that every new bus entering the fleet will be a hybrid by 2012.\"",

     "Mike Weston, Operations Director for London Buses, said: \"It is great to be recognised for this project.",
     "\"Increasing the number of hybrid buses in the fleet is just one of the projects we are working on to reduce emissions and help tackle climate change.\"",

Thanks to continuous charging of the battery, the vehicle can meet the existing range of a conventional diesel bus\\u003cbr /\\u003e\"]}"
