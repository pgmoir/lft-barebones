     "Bus drivers and control staff are doing an excellent job dealing with additional demand, supported by CentreComm, London Buses' 24/7 Emergency Command and Control Centre.",
     "Articulated or bendy buses have been a particular success.",
     "These buses can carry almost 150 passengers each, and with three doors allowing passengers to board quickly and easily they have helped reduce serious congestion and ease pressure at major interchanges.",
     "A TfL spokesman said: \"We are putting extra staff out over the course of the next three days in order to help passengers get to their destinations as quickly and safely as possible.",
     "\"The best way to relieve some of the stress during times of serious disruption like this is to make sure passengers have information, maps and advice on how they can complete their journeys.",
     "\"We urge passengers to leave extra time for their journeys today and to consider using other modes of transport including walking and cycling.Â  Information on this is available in \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/journeyplanner\"\u003eJourney Planner \u003c/a\u003e on the \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk\"\u003eTfL website\u003c/a\u003e .\""
