     "Gatwick Express is a popular choice with visitors to London from around the world.",
     "The Oyster Card for Visitors is a new, branded card from Transport for London, pre-loaded with pay as you go and ready to use on the system for passengers as soon as they arrive in central London.",
     "Ken Livingstone, Mayor of London, said: 'This deal with Gatwick Express is another good example of the work that we are doing to make it easier for visitors to London to get around the city.",
     "'The Oyster system is a proven success, with more than 10 million cards issued.",
     "'This deal enables us to reach more people coming to London from overseas, meaning that more visitors can get the benefits of cheaper, simpler, and quicker journeys that come with using the Oyster card.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Customer benefit\"}",
     "Peter Cotton, Managing Director of Gatwick Express, said: 'By teaming up with TfL to allow us to sell Oyster cards, Gatwick Express is once again delivering yet another customer benefit for their passengers who may be taking day trips to the Capital from the local Gatwick area or just as importantly are overseas travellers visiting London for leisure and or business'.",
     "Visit London's Chief Executive, James Bidwell, says: 'London has one of the most comprehensive public transport networks of any major city and it is one of our greatest assets.",
     "'We welcome the new Oyster card for Visitors on Gatwick Express which will further increase the opportunities for visitors to buy the card before arriving in the city.",
     "'We look forward to working with TfL and other partners to continue to raise the profile of the Oyster card overseas.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Timeless\"}",
     "The announcement is part of TfL's strategy to ensure that visitors to London have access to the cheaper options available with Oyster.",
     "By making the cards easy to get hold of before a passenger even arrives in London, it saves time on queuing for tickets leaving people more time to enjoy their visit.",
     "Instead of buying a paper card, visitors can work out how often they will use public transport in London and top-up their Oyster Card for visitors accordingly.",
     "The pay as you go money on the card is timeless so people can use any money left over for future visits to London or give it to someone else who is visiting London.",
