     "Tottenham Court Road Tube station is one of the busiest and most congested stations on the network used by over 125,000 passengers per day.",
     "As demand is expected to exceed current capacity at this prominent West End site within the next few years, it is in urgent need of improvement.",
     "In order to have a bigger station the space under the road and pavement where the ticket hall needs to be enlarged is currently full of sewers and pipes carrying electricity, gas, telecommunications and water.",
     "All these utilities have to be diverted before we can start enlarging the station. The work will take 18 months.",
     "Richard Parry, London Underground's (LU's) Strategy and Service Director, said: \"The utility diversion works are needed for the station upgrade. They will be phased to reduce potential impact, so not all areas will be affected at the same time. The station will not close as a result of the diversion works.",
     "\"TfL's £10bn Investment Programme is all about providing a better service.",
     "\"The upgraded Tottenham Court Road station will have five new lifts providing step-free access from street to platform level, and improved entrances.",
     "\"An enlarged ticket hall and eight new escalators will relieve current congestion and improve journey times.",
     "\"The improved station will not only provide a more efficient interchange between transport services, but will at street level, provide much needed additions to pavement space and pedestrian crossing capacity.",
     "\"As a result the new station is anticipated to be a catalyst for regeneration and new investment in the area.\"",
     "LU applied for, and was granted, planning permission to undertake vital diversions, and has been working closely with the London Borough of Camden and Westminster City Council (because the work will be in both boroughs) and other local major projects to minimise disruption in the Tottenham Court Road vicinity while work is taking place.",
     "A 24-hour Help Desk will be in operation seven days a week throughout the utility diversions.",
