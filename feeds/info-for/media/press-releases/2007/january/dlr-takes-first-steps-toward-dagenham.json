     "A further round of consultation will take place in spring to seek views on individual route options.",
     "The proposed extension, which could open in 2016, would extend east from the existing DLR network at Gallions Reach with possible new stations at Beckton Riverside, Creekmouth, Barking Riverside, Dagenham Vale and Dagenham Dock.",
     "The area is set to benefit from a wide-ranging housing and business regeneration programme over the next few years as part of the Government's Thames Gateway initiative.",
     "Richard De Cani, DLR Head of Planning and Development, said: \"Past DLR extensions have successfully assisted the regeneration of the areas they encompass and we are confident a link to Dagenham Dock would prove just as beneficial.",
     "\"Views from interested parties have previously proved invaluable and as such I would urge people to read and respond to our leaflet. DLR prides itself on its effective consultation and we look forward to working alongside the local community over the next few years.\"",
     "Further consultation activities will be announced later this year, including local meetings, exhibitions and open days.",
     "DLR's most recent extensions, to London City Airport in 2005 and Lewisham in 1999, have assisted local regeneration and improved accessibility for residents to jobs and other services. The lines opened ahead of schedule and on budget and passenger numbers continue to grow steadily on both.",
