However, the football fixture list is not issued until June, with the first match in August with fixtures often moved at short notice at Sky TV direction to meet their schedules. Moving closures has a financial consequence for London Underground as it needs to compensate Tube Lines and Metronet for abortive work, and the impact on their schedule to deliver upgrade works. We have communicated our programme to both the Football Association and Sky TV.  However, this could mean that a clash between engineering works and some football fixtures becomes unavoidable in future\\u003cbr /\\u003e\"]}",
