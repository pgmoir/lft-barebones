     "LU has appointed Mott MacDonald to be lead consultant for the detailed design through to construction of the Victoria Station upgrade, as part of Transport for London's £10bn Investment Programme.",
     "The £509m project is due to start in 2009 and be complete in 2014.",
     "When complete, the project will increase the size of the station by about 50 per cent with a new ticket hall, lifts and escalators to ease congestion and provide step-free access from street level to Victoria, Circle and District line platforms.",
     "Used by over 75 million passengers each year, Victoria Underground station is at the heart of London's transport network, but severe congestion during the morning rush hour has made it necessary to stop passengers coming into the station for a few minutes, so that the platforms don't become too overcrowded - this crowd control safety measure has to be used several times every weekday.",
     "The upgrade of Victoria station is one of several plans by LU to ease congestion at stations.",
     "As a result of London's growing population by 2016, it is estimated that the Tube could be carrying 25 per cent more passengers, which is equivalent to an average 3.4million passengers every day.",
     "This demonstrates the need for continued investment in the Tube and London's transport network to increase capacity.",
     "Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, said: \"The £509m redevelopment of Victoria Station is a great example of the huge investment being made to improve the Tube and transport across the Capital.",
     "\"This expansion is essential to meet London's continued growth and development and to support the extra capacity on the Victoria line, due to be delivered by new trains and signalling system in 2013.\"",
     "LU Managing Director, Tim O'Toole, said: \"Upgrading Victoria Underground station is a key part of improving the Tube network which will cut congestion and improve access for all our passengers using the station.",
     "\"Together with the full Victoria line upgrade, this will deliver much needed capacity and provide a safe, reliable and accessible station, fit for the 21st Century.\"",
     "Subject to the necessary consents being secured, this key project is due to begin construction in 2009 delivering major passenger benefits by 2014 including:",
