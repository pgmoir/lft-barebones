     "This first-ever branded Oyster will feature an eye-catching image of the boy king Tutankhamun in celebration of the exhibition coming to The O2 in November.",
     "Some of the treasures from Tutankhamun's tomb were last displayed in the UK in 1972 and attracted some 1.7 million visitors, setting travelling exhibition attendance records.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe special edition Tutankhamun Oyster Card went on sale to O2 customers on Tuesday 28 August and to the wider public on 12 September.",
     "The card works in the same way as a normal pay as you go Visitor Oyster Card offering the lowest fares available, and will be sold in conjunction with tickets to the show through Visit London, TicketMaster, See tickets and Seatem.",
