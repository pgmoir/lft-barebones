     "Fluorescent jackets, reflectors and mushroom helmets may put off many from cycling in the Capital, but a new clothing show has a solution for fashion conscious Londoners.",
     "Lots of people will see the marriage of bikes and fashion as a perfect match",
     "On Thursday 21 June, Prêt à Rouler, London's first cycle clothing fashion show, organised by cycle shop Velorution and sponsored by Transport for London (TfL), will take place at the Village Underground, Shoreditch, between 19:00 and 22:00.",
     "Following the huge boom in cycling in the Capital in recent years, more and more stylish Londoners are taking to this popular and healthy form of transport.",
     "Velorution, which is at the forefront of cycle-chic, will showcase several designers' innovative and exceptional take on cycle clothing.",
     "Models on bikes will show off a combination of garments and bicycles from fashion veterans, established brands and rising stars in this one day extravaganza.",
     "Jenny Jones, Mayor's Green transport advisor, said: \"Cycling is a healthy and quick way of moving around London, so let's make it stylish as well.",

     "\"Lots of people will see the marriage of bikes and fashion as a perfect match.",
     "\"Cycling can be an every day activity for every day clothes, or you can opt for something more fun and fashionable.\"",
     "Adrian Bell, Sustainable Mobility Manager, Cycling, Walking and Accessibility at Transport for London (TfL), said: \"The image of cycling has been transformed in recent years but it still isn't commonly associated with cutting edge fashion.",
     "\"We want to show people of all ages and backgrounds that cycling doesn't mean lots of lycra and that it is possible to arrive by bike and look good.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Bicycle style\"}",
     "\"Cycling has never been more popular in the Capital; we hope that Prêt à Rouler will convince even more Londoners they can still be fashionable on two wheels.\"",
     "Designer Karta Healey, one of the first to sign up to the show, turned to fashion while snowboarding and found that none of the clothing worked for him.",
     "He successfully worked with Nick Ashley on a motorcycle clothing range and now is ready to debut his cycle wear range 'TWOnFRO'.",
     "Another name on the fashion circuit is Junky Styling, based in Brick Lane.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Unique insight\"}",
     "Their re-worked masterpieces are surprisingly made from frumpy old garments destined for the recycling bin, and this summer they are on hand to display their interpretation of bicycle style, which is guaranteed to impress.",
     "Other names showing include Guy Hills, Vexed Generation, Keith and Dunstan James, and Rapha.",
     "Prêt à Rouler will be much more than a fashion show and designers will be on hand at the end of the show to give their unique insight into the design process, and how they find inspiration.",
