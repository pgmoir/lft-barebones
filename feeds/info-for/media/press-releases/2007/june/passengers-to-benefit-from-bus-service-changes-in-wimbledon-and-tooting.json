     "Transport for London (TfL) is pleased to announce the re-routing of bus route 493 and the extension of route 131.",
     "We are delighted with the planned changes to routes 493 and 131",
     "From 30 June, bus route 493 will be re-routed between Wimbledon and St. George's Hospital, Tooting, to serve Alexandra Road, Gap Road, Plough Lane and Blackshaw Road.",
     "Route 131 will be extended from Wimbledon to Tooting from the same date.",
     "Local residents, bus users and hospital staff and visitors, will especially benefit from the 493 along Plough Lane and part of Blackshaw Road currently unserved by buses.",
     "The 493 will no longer serve Wimbledon Bridge, The Broadway, Merton Road, South Wimbledon, Merton High Street and Colliers Wood High Street, but route 131 will provide an improved double-decker service along these roads.",
     "The 131 will also be more frequent, running every eight minutes Mondays to Saturdays and every 12 minutes on Sundays.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Great benefit\"}",
     "John Barry, Head of Network Development for London Buses, said: \"We worked closely with both Wandsworth and Merton Councils in developing these changes.",
     "\"We believe they will be of great benefit to local bus users.\"",
     "Mary Kyne, General Manager Facilities for St.George's Healthcare NHS Trust, said: \"We are delighted with the planned changes to routes 493 and 131 as this improves the bus connections to the site.",
     "\"We are especially pleased that the views of our staff, patients and visitors were taken into account when planning the services.\""
