     "From 1 July 2007, smoking will no longer be permitted while waiting at bus shelters or while travelling in any taxi or private hire vehicle, in line with new legislation being introduced across England.",
     "That legislation will make illegal to smoke in virtually all enclosed public places, workplaces and public and work vehicles, including public transport and buildings associated with public transport.",
     "Although smoking has been banned on all Transport for London property and across all modes of public transport for many years, the new legislation will mean smoking in all taxis and private hire vehicles will now be illegal.  Previously, drivers could decide whether or not to allow passengers to smoke in their vehicles.  Smoking will also be banned within shelters at bus stops.",
     "The Department of Health anticipates that the new legislation will save thousands of lives over the next decade by reducing the amount of second-hand smoke in enclosed public places and workplaces.",
