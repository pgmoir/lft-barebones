     "The northbound Blackwall Tunnel has been closed since 12.30 today due to a load which fell from a vehicle. The fire brigade and police have been on site to clear the scene as the load contained asbestos. TfL is currently on site to assess the air quality in the tunnel and once satisfied it is expected to re-open shortly before 7pm. Only the southbound tunnel is open at this stage.",
