     "\"As ever we want to hear the views of residents on this scheme, and hope that as many people as possible take up the opportunity to participate in the consultation process.\"",
     "At first, the service will run between Barking and Barking Riverside, and as more people and businesses move to the area, the service will extend to Dagenham Dock.",
