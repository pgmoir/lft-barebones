     "Mayor of London Ken Livingstone today announced that the campaign to encourage all Londoners, particularly those on a low income, to use an Oyster card, is making real progress.",
     "The campaign, which includes giving away 100,000 Oyster cards on a 'first come, first served basis' to new customers, has seen more than half the free cards (almost 57,000) snapped up in just two weeks.",
     "The Oyster cards are being given away through national, local and community press adverts, targeting communities where take-up is comparatively low.",
     "The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, said: 'With over half the free cards taken up in just two weeks, this campaign is having a real impact.",
     "'The vast majority of people across London are already enjoying the benefits of Oyster, including cheaper and more convenient journeys.",
     "'We want to encourage Londoners paying more because they still pay by cash to switch to Oyster.",
     "'With more than 10 million cards issued since its launch in 2003, Oyster has cut queues at Tube stations and speeded up buses across London.'",
     "More than three-quarters of all Tube and bus journeys are now made using Oyster.",
     "The latest figures show that the number of single journeys now paid for by cash is extremely low, just 4 per cent on London Underground and 2.5 per cent on buses.",
     "Fares are always cheaper using Oyster; for example a single bus fare using Oyster is £1 compared to the £2 cash fare.",
     "A single Tube fare in zone 1 is £1.50 with Oyster compared to £4 if cash is used.",
     "In fact, Oyster prices have been held down so that they are still the same price as cash fares when Ken Livingstone was first elected Mayor of London in nearly seven years ago.",
