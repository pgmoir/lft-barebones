     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Around 78 per cent of all Tube and bus payments in London are now by Oyster card\",\"In the three years since the introduction of Oyster card, the proportion of cash payments on the Tube and buses has fallen to just three per cent\",\"As an example, with Oyster pay as you go you can load £10 onto your Oyster card and when you touch in and out at the yellow card readers on the Tube, Docklands Light Railway (DLR) and London Overground or touch in on the bus or tram the reader automatically deducts the correct fare\",\"Oyster is available to buy or be topped up at all 275 Tube stations and there are also more than 2,200 Oyster Ticket Stops across the capital. Eighty-five percent of all Londoners live within 400 metres of an Oyster Ticket Stop\",\"Oyster is also available \\u003ca href=\\\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/oyster\\\"\\u003eonline\\u003c/a\\u003e , over the phone via 0845 330 9876 or at Travel Information Centres across London. You can find your nearest Oyster outlet through the TfL website\",\"A returnable £3 deposit is payable if you are only loading cash on your Oyster card to pay as you go but the money saved by switching to Oyster can cover this in just one day's travel\",\"Passengers can also register the card so that the money is protected if the card is lost or stolen. Less ticket touts mean more secure stations\",\"Passengers can store up to three different Travelcards or Bus Pass season tickets and cash to pay as they go on the same Oyster card at the same time. Oyster cards are also used to provide free travel for Londoners aged over 60 or with an eligible disability through the Freedom Pass scheme and, on the buses and trams, under 18s in full-time education can also get Oyster photocards for free travel\",\"When passengers use the Oyster card to touch in and out on the yellow card readers on the Tube, DLR, London Overground and touch in on buses and trams the system automatically works out the right fare for the journey within in a fifth of a second from up to 1.83 million permutations\",\"Almost three times as many passengers can pass through a Tube station entrance/exit gate using an Oyster card as can using printed tickets - 40 a minute compared to 15 a minute\",\"Auto Top-up can be set up on line to ensure that passengers never run out of cash to pay as they go. When your balance drops below £5, it will automatically be topped up with either £20 or £40 the next time you touch in on any yellow card reader on Tube, bus, tram, London Overground or DLR\"]}",
