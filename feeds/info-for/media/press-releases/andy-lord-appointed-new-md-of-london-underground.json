     "Andy spent more than 25 years at British Airways.  Having joined as a sponsored Engineering undergraduate, he progressed to a variety of senior roles across the airline finally serving as their Director of Operations from 2008 to 2015.",
     "The appointment of Andy Lord now means that Nigel Holness, who is the current Managing Director of London Underground following Mark Wild's appointment as the new CEO of Crossrail Limited, will be leaving the organisation to take up his previously announced position of Chief Executive for Metro Trains Sydney.  Mark Wild will stay as the CEO of Crossrail Limited until the full opening of the Elizabeth Line.",
     "Over the next few months before Andy joins TfL, Vernon Everitt, the Managing Director of Customers, Communication \u0026 Technology, will cover the Managing Director of London Underground position and will work with the leadership team to ensure there is a strong business plan and a safe and reliable Tube service.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Mike Brown MVO, said:",
     "'I am delighted that Andy has agreed to become the new Managing Director for London Underground. He brings more than 30 years of experience from the aviation industry, with a heavy focus on engineering, people leadership and customer service and a wealth of experience in delivering safe and reliable transport services. I am sure his fresh viewpoint and knowledge will help us continue to deliver reliable and improved services for our customers.",
     "'I also want to thank Nigel Holness for all his work for London Underground over his career and agreeing to be Managing Director following Mark Wild's move to Crossrail Limited. Nigel has been instrumental in helping to deliver new signalling, improved and more accessible stations and the introduction of the Night Tube. We wish him all the best in his new role in Australia.'",
     "Andy Lord, new Managing Director of London Underground, said:",
     "'I'm delighted to be joining TfL at such an exciting time and to be working with the fantastic team at London Underground who are so critical to delivering day in, day out for London.'",
     "Every day, around five million journeys are made using London Underground, with 7 December 2018 as the busiest day in the Tube's 155 year history. Across the network, millions of pounds of investment is being made, including new walk-through trains on the Piccadilly line, delivering new signalling to increase capacity through central London and major station improvements which is increasing the number of step-free stations across the city.",
