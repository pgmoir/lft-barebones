     "The City of London's work on the Aldgate Gyratory will conclude on Saturday 30 April . The re-opening of Aldgate bus station will allow many bus services in the area to return to their usual routes, including 15, 25, 40, 42, 67, 78, 100, 115, 135, 205, 254, N15, N205, N253, N550 and N551.",
     "There will be some changes to bus stops in the area to reflecting the new road design and passengers should check information displayed in the area or here: \u003ca href=\"http://tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/improvements-and-projects/aldgate-gyratory\"\u003etfl.gov.uk/travel-information/improvements-and-projects/aldgate-gyratory\u003c/a\u003e ",
     "During the temporary closure of Liverpool Street Bus Station, an access passage connecting the new Elizabeth line ticket hall to Liverpool Street Tube station was built adjacent to the bus station. When the bus station re-opens this weekend, bus routes 11, 23, 133, N11 and N133 will serve it.  Bus route 153, which is currently only running as far as Moorgate, Finsbury Square will also return to the bus station.",
     "When the Elizabeth line opens in 2018 it will provide passengers across London and the South East with quicker and more reliable journeys, new trains and better stations.",
