     "\"The addition of BP forecourt stores to the retailers that already accept payment for the congestion charge will make paying the charge even more convenient.",
     "\"Drivers can already pay their congestion charge at more than 250 petrol stations and 1,800 retail outlets within the M25, and over 11,000 throughout the rest of the UK, as well as by phone, text and on-line.",
     "\"Finding your nearest payment facility is also made easier with the online congestion charge \"Payment Finder\" which lists the ten nearest retail outlets to your given post code.\"",
     "A BP spokesperson said: \"It makes sense that motorists have the opportunity to pay for their congestion charge at places which are convenient to them, so what better way to pay it than on your way into London while filling up with fuel and buying their shop goods.\"",
