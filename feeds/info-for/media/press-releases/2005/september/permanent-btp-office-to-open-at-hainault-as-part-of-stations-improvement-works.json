     "This work is part of TfL's £10bn 5-Year Investment Programme, and is being undertaken by Metronet Rail BCV.",
     "The plans for the new police office were welcomed by British Transport Police Sector Commander Andy Hunt, who said: \"We are very pleased that the refurbishment will include a new police office.",
     "\"It will give us a local base which will help us to consolidate our ties with the local community and provide a centre for reassurance policing in the area.\"",
     "Step-free access to the platforms is also a key feature of the modernisation work and will be provided by the installation of two lifts.",
     "The station will remain open while being modernised and passengers should not be affected by the works.",
     "However, hoardings will be erected on platform one, which will limit platform space and therefore prevent use of the waiting rooms.",
     "Some weekend/late-night closures may apply later on in the project but, where possible, Metronet will take advantage of weekend track closures to undertake major works.",
     "Modernisation works will also include the building of a new control room in the ticket hall, the restoration of heritage features, the replacement of all CCTV cameras, the installation of customer Help Points, an enhanced public address system, and tactile strips on platforms and contrasting handrails for the partially sighted.",
     "All cabling will be concealed and ticket hall ceilings will be either replaced or decorated.",
