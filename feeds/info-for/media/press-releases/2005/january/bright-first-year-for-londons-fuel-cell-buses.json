     "\" London Buses regards the first year of the two year fuel cell bus project a great success. The buses have excelled in reliability and have been very popular with passengers who have appreciated the amazing environmental benefits of fuel cell technology and the quiet, smooth ride the buses offer. \"",
     "\" These trials are a positive indication that hydrogen fuel cells could offer an alternative to diesel in the future. The high cost of the vehicles is the major barrier at the moment but providing the Government continues to provide support for this promising technology, it could be a viable option for the future. \"",

     "\"Â Passengers are always asking questions about the benefits of the fuel cell bus and when I tell them they are always really supportive of the trial. I am very proud to be an essential part of this trial as this technology will benefit our environment substantially - its something I'll tell the grandkids about! \"",
     "Richard Tarboton, Head of Business Unit Transport Energy, part of the Energy Saving Trust said:",
     "\" The success of this trial to date demonstrates the real opportunity offered by hydrogen fuel cell technology. It is also an important step towards the Government's Powering Future Vehicles Strategy that calls for 600 low carbon buses on the road each year by 2012. \"",
     "\" EST is delighted to support such an important technological advance. Using renewable hydrogen in the future these buses will offer significantly lower CO2 emissions, one of the green house gases attributed to climate change, as well as improve air quality with a reduction in oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), emissions closely associated with respiratory problems. \"",
