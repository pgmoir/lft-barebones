     "\"We value our staff at London Underground. I know how hard they work, every day, to provide a 'Good Service' to Tube passengers.",
     "\"It is essential that our staff are easily recognisable so passengers can seek help and assistance when needed, but they also need a uniform that looks good, is hard wearing and is comfortable to wear in all types of weather wherever they work on the Underground.",
     "\"So I'm delighted that we were able to work with them to improve the uniform. It is in a new, darker blue colour, which I think makes Tube staff look very smart and professional. I am sure it will be appreciated by staff and passengers alike.\"",
