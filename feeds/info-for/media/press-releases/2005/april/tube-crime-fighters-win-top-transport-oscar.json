     "The Mayor and TfL have also funded an extra 200 BTP officers specifically for the Tube over the past two years, an increase of 50 per cent.",
     "The BTP / LU Crime \u0026 Disorder Partnership unit is unique in the transport industry. The judges recognised the excellent progress the Partnership has made in tackling and reducing crime and anti-social behaviour on the Tube, particularly through the use of Anti Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs).",
     "John Strutton, Crime and Disorder Partnership Manager, said:\"The safety of Tube passengers and staff is our top priority. This award is an acknowledgement of the real working Partnership developed between London Underground and British Transport Police and the results it has achieved.",
     "\"Through working together, we've made great strides towards reducing crime on the Tube and providing a safer and more welcoming environment for customers and staff.\"",
     "Chief Inspector Dave Dickason BTP, said: \"One of the most effective ways the Partnership has been able to make an impact is through the issuing of ASBOs. Over 50 were issued last year, bringing the total to 125 that are currently in operation.",
     "\"ASBOs are a real deterrent and have proved their worth combating the more serious and persistent anti social offenders. Any breach of an ASBO would attract severe penalties, ranging up to five years imprisonment.\"",
     "The BTP / LU Crime and Disorder Partnership unit was set up in 2000 using an innovative partnership approach to reduce crime on the Tube. The unit consists of dedicated LU managers and revenue staff working alongside specialist BTP staff.\u003cbr /\u003e"
