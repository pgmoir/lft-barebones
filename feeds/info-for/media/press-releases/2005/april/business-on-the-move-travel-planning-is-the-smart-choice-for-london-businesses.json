     "The event, organised by Central London Partnership (CLP) and Transport for London (TfL) in association with the British Council for Offices, will concentrate on the importance of using travel plans to create a sustainable environment for London businesses in both economic and environmental terms.",
     "Travel planning is an effective business management tool which can be used to generate cost savings, lending companies a competitive advantage, and which has additional benefits for the environment and the health of employees.",
     "Recognising the value of creating a sustainable business environment, the public and private sectors can work in partnership to create and maintain effective business travel plans.",
     "Ken Livingstone, Mayor of London, said: \"London is the fastest growing major city in Europe. That is a testament to our dynamism and success. To sustain London's growth and prosperity we have to expand the city's transport system and are working to ensure that those assets we already have are used with the maximum efficiency. Business travel plans can make a big difference to ensuring we get the most out of our transport system and that businesses start the day efficiently by helping employees plan the most reliable and healthy journey to work.\"",
     "Travel planning can involve developing policies to promote walking and cycling, encouraging car sharing, introducing flexible working arrangements and making a company's vehicles and those of its suppliers more environmentally friendly. Benefits include increased accessibility on site for employees, visitors and deliveries, more efficient use of resources, and greater reliability for business travel. In the long term, making better use of the transport network will allow London to continue to thrive as a profitable economic centre.",
     "Patricia Brown, Chief Executive of Central London Partnership, said: \"Transport is a key concern for businesses in central London. Both the public and private sectors need to recognise the benefits of effective travel planning and incorporate it into their business plans. Making the most of the range of travel options available will not only reduce the pressure on public transport, it can also bring about important financial benefits for a company and health benefits for staff.\"",
