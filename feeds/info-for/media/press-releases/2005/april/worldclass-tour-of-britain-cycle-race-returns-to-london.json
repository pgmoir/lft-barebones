     "Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone said: 'In the year that London bids to host the 2012 Olympic Games, we are delighted to once again welcome the final stage of the Tour of Britain. This important national event will further showcase London's ability to promote a world-class sporting fixture to a global audience.",

     "The race comes as Londoners are showing an increasing enthusiasm for cycling in the capital for recreation and transport. London-wide cycling increased 23% to May last year compared with 2003/4 and it has increased 62% on Transport for London's road network since 2001. This is the fastest growth in cycling of anywhere in the UK.",
     "To help achieve this, TfL's cycling budget is rising from £12 million in 2004 to £19.2 million in 2005/06.",

This race provides a great opportunity for Londoners and other visitors to be inspired by the sport and encouraged to take it up.\"",
     "With an estimated 100,000 people expected to watch the last stage of the tour, it is also a major boost for tourism in the capital.",
     "The thousands of spectators can also enjoy a host of cultural events also taking place. The activities will give an added economic boost to the capital. According to Visit London, in 2004 65 per cent of spectators came from outside London and went on to visit other attractions spending around £30 per head.",
     "London Development Agency Head of Tourism, Anita Thornberry, said: \"The Tour of Britain is a fantastic sporting spectacle and a highly popular free tourist event, bringing thousands of extra visitors to London. It also strengthens London's Olympic bid showing that the capital, working with partners around the country, is able to deliver major events and underlining our passion for sport. This is part of our work to bring more high-profile events to London to make the capital an even more exciting, dynamic tourist destination.\"",
