     "A colourful alphabet frieze is provided for display and further stimulation.",
     "Chris Lines, Head of TfL's London Road Safety Unit, said: \"Having introduced a number of initiatives to improve the Capital's road safety record, we've seen the number of children killed or seriously injured on London's roads fall by 48 per cent since 1998.",
     "\"However, there is still a long way to go, and one child hurt on our roads is one too many.",
     "\"We hope that by providing teachers with the means to include road safety messages while meeting national curriculum requirements, we can equip children from an early age with the knowledge that will help keep them safe on London's roads.\"",
