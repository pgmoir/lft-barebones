     "This register is a system that allows the UK police to identify the owner of any registered item of property.",

     "Ms Jones said: \"London has been very successful in increasing the number of cyclists, but if we don't make cycle theft more difficult then many people will be put off using their bikes.",

     "\"This is compounded by so few bikes ever making it back to their owners.",
     "\"By registering their bicycles, owners have a fighting chance of getting them back.\"",
     "To help take the risk out of buying second-hand bicycles, cyclists and traders will be able to check if the bike they intend to buy has been registered as lost or stolen on this database by visiting \u003ca href=\"http://www.checkmend.org\"\u003ewww.checkmend.org\u003c/a\u003e .",
     "London is leading a cycling renaissance, with more than 300,000 cycle trips every day.",
     "However, security is one of the biggest barriers to encouraging people to cycle in London.",
     "TfL, along with the London boroughs, has installed 10,000 secure on-street cycle parking spaces and 5,000 spaces at schools and colleges, with thousands more to come.",
     "Detective Superintendent Martin Stevens of the Metropolitan Police said: \"The Metropolitan Police fully supports the new database and hopes that the benefits of having a single system of identification for bicycles in London has the same operational benefits as is the case with mobile phones.\"",

If the lock only goes through the wheel a thief may steal the bike and leave the wheel behind.\"]}",
