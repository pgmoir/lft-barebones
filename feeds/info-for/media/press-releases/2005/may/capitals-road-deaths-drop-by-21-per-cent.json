     "These results mean that the Capital has almost reached the Mayor's target to cut death and serious injury on the roads by 40 per cent by 2010.",
     "Mayor of London Ken Livingstone said: \"We are now almost within touching distance of our 2010 targets a full five years early, however, 216 deaths is totally unacceptable and I believe the time is now right to raise the bar.",
     "\"I am asking Transport for London to start work with the boroughs and the police with a view to establishing an even more challenging target of a 50 per cent reduction by 2010 in the number of deaths and serious injuries on the Capital's roads.\"",
