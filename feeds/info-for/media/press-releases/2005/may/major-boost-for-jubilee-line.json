     "This extra seventh car will be a real boost to all Jubilee line passengers, increasing capacity by nearly a fifth across the whole line",
     "From January 2006, an extra seventh carriage is to be added to all Jubilee line trains, boosting passenger capacity by 17 per cent.",
     "Four new trains will also be added, increasing the train fleet from 59 to 63 trains.",
     "The improvements are due to be delivered by Tube Lines.",
     "The news follows improved performance figures published last week by London Underground (LU), which show that last year the Tube carried more passengers than ever before, reliability reached a seven-year high and LU's best customer satisfaction scores yet were recorded.",
     "All the improvements are part of Transport for London's (TfL) £10bn 5-year Investment Programme, to improve and expand London's transport network.",
     "The Mayor said: \"This extra seventh car will be a real boost to all Jubilee line passengers, increasing capacity by nearly a fifth across the whole line, or an extra 3,000 passengers every morning and evening peak.",
     "\"London Underground is improving and the Jubilee line is safer, cleaner and more reliable than it has been for many years.",
     "\"But we know there is much more to do.",
     "\"That's why the Jubilee line will also receive a full line upgrade to increase capacity by 45 per cent, due for delivery by Tube Lines in 2009.\"",
     "In order to ensure a safe and reliable introduction of the new seven-carriage trains, LU will have to gradually reduce the existing Jubilee line six-carriage service throughout December 2005, and close the line entirely for five days between December 25-30.",
     "This is because six- and seven-carriage trains cannot be run at the same time and to ensure rigorous testing of the trains and the improved signalling system prior to their introduction into passenger service. The new seven-carriage train Jubilee line service will then be gradually introduced in early January 2006.",
     "George McInulty, LU Service Director for the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines (JNP), said: \"We ask passengers to understand that we need to reduce the Jubilee line service in December 2005, to help us ensure a smooth, safe and reliable delivery of the improved seven-carriage service in January 2006.",
     "\"We've chosen to reduce the service in December and close the line over Christmas as this is the time of the year when the Tube is most lightly used.",
     "\"Replacement bus services will be in operation when the line is closed.\"",
     "Currently, the Jubilee line capacity is approximately 16,500 people per hour when running 24 trains per hour.",
     "With the introduction of seven-carriage trains and an extra four trains, LU will be introducing a new timetable in January 2006.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Special timetable\"}",
     "This will allow it to meet rising Jubilee line passenger demand and enable 19,500 passengers per hour to be carried.",
     "Bus replacement services will be provided during the five-day closure.",
     "A special Jubilee line timetable will be operated during December 2005 and January 2006 as follows:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"\\u003cstrong\\u003e4-24 December 2005:\\u003c/strong\\u003e The peak service offered on the Jubilee line will be reduced as six-carriage trains are progressively withdrawn from service to be converted into seven-carriage trains.
