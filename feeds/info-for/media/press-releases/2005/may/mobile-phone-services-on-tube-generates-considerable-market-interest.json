     "The closing date for receipt of expressions of interest was the end of April but due to the continued high level of response, LU has decided to extend the deadline to 24 May 2005.",
     "A notice has been placed in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) advising of the new closing date.",
     "In March, Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of London, announced LU's intention to approach the market seeking interest in the possible introduction of mobile phone services and new technology services such as DAB digital radio, DVB digital video broadcasting and wireless internet on the Tube.",
     "Income generated for LU by this venture would be re-invested in the Tube network, to fund further improvements for passengers.",

     "Because of all the services this project could possibly deliver, LU will engage in a full OJEU tendering process rather than engage in contractual negotiations now with a limited number of suppliers.",
     "This is intended to ensure the best services and best value for LU and its customers and ultimately deliver mobile and new technology services that our customers want.",
     "LU Director of Strategy \u0026 Service Development, Richard Parry said: \"We have received an excellent initial response from the market, who have demonstrated considerable interest in providing both mobile phone services and other exciting technologies for LU customers.",
     "\"Once the extended deadline for receipt has passed we intend to issue a consultation document to those who have expressed interest so that we can get further information from the market about how we could best provide these services.\"",
