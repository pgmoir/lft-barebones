     "The wonderfully artistic and beautifully illustrated poster ads from the 1920s and 1930s are adorned with great slogans like: \"The daffodils are out - what about you?\" and \"Spring beckons you!\"",
     "London Underground has worked closely with London's Transport Museum to select the classic posters from its huge archive of designs, created to promote the Tube as one of the best ways to get out and about in London.",
     "Robert Kennan, Head of the Print Department at Bonhams*, commented: \"The 1920s and 30s were when the art of the London Underground truly blossomed, producing some of the most iconic graphic designs of the 20th century. The predominant style was Art Deco, a modern, colourful, dynamic and light hearted aesthetic that reflected the optimism of the period.",
     "\"Whilst the name of McKnight Kauffer is legendary amongst the designers of the period, the vast majority have been forgotten. Despite this, individuals such as Hutton, Paine and Faulkener, who are only known to academics or poster collectors, all had the opportunity to be part of one of the greatest publicity campaigns ever. \"",
     "London Underground's Head of Communications, Andrew Jones said:",
     "\"These wonderful vintage posters were created in the 1920s and 1930s to encourage Londoners to use the Tube as one of the quickest and most reliable ways to see more of their city.",
     "\"That remains true to this day and we hope 21st century Tube users will enjoy these posters just as much and use the Underground to get out and enjoy all that London has to offer this Spring.",
     "\"We are also delighted to team up, once again, with London's Transport Museum, who provided the posters. London Underground has a great design history and as we start to rebuild and renew the Tube for the 21st Century, we hope to emulate that tradition.\"",
     "If a particular poster catches your eye whilst travelling on the Tube this Spring, you can buy a reproduction of your own from the Transport Museum in Covent Garden Piazza or online at \u003ca href=\"http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk\"\u003ewww.ltmuseum.co.uk\u003c/a\u003e .",
     "The Museum's Head Curator, Oliver Green, said: \"Vintage posters are one of our best sellers. They have a firm place in the travelling public's hearts and really help us to celebrate the contribution London Underground has made to the history, design and development of this great city.",
     "\"We hope that Tube passengers will enjoy the posters, get out on the Tube to enjoy London this Spring and take the time to visit London's Transport Museum, perhaps to pick up a vintage poster of their own.\"\u003cbr /\u003e"
