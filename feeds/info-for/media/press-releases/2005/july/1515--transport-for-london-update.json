     "Extra security checks are in place but passengers should remain vigilant and question any suspect items or behaviour and immediately inform Tube staff or the Police.",
     "We especially ask that passengers be extra careful not to leave belongings behind or leave litter on trains or at stations as these will cause unnecessary security alerts at a time when the emergency services are at full stretch.",

     "A number of Tube stations had to be temporarily closed this morning due to unattended items being left in stations.",
     "Extensive damage has been caused to the three trains in yesterday's terrorist attacks at Edgware Road, Aldgate and Russell Square. The track at these three locations has also been damaged. No sections of tunnel have collapsed.",
     "We will not be able to identify the extent of damage until we can access the three sites and undertake structural surveys.",
     "A criminal investigation is ongoing and takes precedence but as soon as we get control back from the Police we will be working extremely hard to get services back to normal.",
     "We hope to get the Circle and Hammersmith \u0026 City lines back up and running within days but we do not expect services on the central section of the Piccadilly line to be restored for several weeks.",
     "One London Underground employee was injured in yesterday's attacks. He is currently in a critical condition.",
     "Passenger numbers will be lower today than on a normal Friday in London but as the days go on we anticipate that Londoners will return to using the Tube in the same numbers they did before.",
     "Tim O'Toole, Managing Director, London Underground said: \"This was the worst terrorist attack in the history of London Underground. Innocent individuals travelling to work or going about their normal daily business lost their lives on a system they trusted to get them about London. Hundreds others were injured. My deepest condolences and those of all Underground staff are with the friends and families of all those killed and injured.",
     "\"I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all London Underground staff for their heroic response to yesterday's atrocities. Prior to the arrival of the emergency services they had to work in the most appalling and difficult of situations that most of us will thankfully never experience. In particular, I want to pay tribute to the staff of the Emergency Response Unit who played a critical role in removing the dead and injured from the carnage underground. Along with emergency service personnel who worked tirelessly throughout the day; they were a credit to London.",
     "\"The magnificent and calm response shown by passengers also helped to make a very difficult situation better.",
     "\"With 3 million passengers a day the difficulty in today's global security climate is striking the balance between running a mass transit service and introducing security measures that prevent people travelling in London. In conjunction with the Police, we are reviewing our current security arrangements and will introduce new measures if they so request.\"",
