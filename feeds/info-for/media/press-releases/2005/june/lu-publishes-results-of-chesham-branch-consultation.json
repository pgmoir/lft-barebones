     "A total of 315 responses were received.",
     "The public consultation highlighted that the majority of respondents have significant concerns about the proposals.",
     "Eighty-six per cent of Chesham residents were against withdrawal of through trains at peak periods.",

     "Once this is complete, LU will decide in autumn 2005 whether or not to agree to the withdrawal of the Chesham peak through service.",
     "This means that there will be no change to the current Chesham service until summer 2006 at the earliest.",
