     "Ken Livingstone said: \"This is a major step in delivering on my manifesto for the second mayoral term.",
     "\"Free travel for under-16 year olds is a radical investment in London's future.",

     "Roger Draper, Chief Executive of Sport England, said: \"This is great news and means that London's youngsters and sports stars of the future can get access to sport more easily.",
