     "Transport for London (TfL) and the Department for Transport (DfT), sponsors of Crossrail, have today confirmed that Crossrail services will call at Woolwich following the conclusion of a funding agreement for the completion of the station.",
     "The sponsors have given Crossrail Limited the go ahead to begin the procurement process for the station fit out which will mean the station can open, alongside the rest of the central section of the Crossrail route, in December 2018.",
     "The new station at Woolwich will support the regeneration of this part of London improving connectivity and access to job opportunities.",

     "However, during the passage of the Crossrail Bill, an agreement was reached for Berkeley Homes to construct the station box.",
     "This agreement was confirmed in February 2011.",
     "Since then TfL and DfT have been in discussions with Berkeley Homes and the Royal Borough of Greenwich to develop an additional funding package for the fit out of the station so that it is ready for trains to serve the station when they start operating at the end of 2018.",
     "The new station will improve transport connectivity, providing a direct route to Canary Wharf, central London and beyond.",
     "It will support sustainable economic development and population growth by increasing capacity and reducing congestion on the transport network.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"World-class trains\"}",

It is a massive win for Woolwich and offers enormous potential for local regeneration.'",
     "Crossrail Minister Stephen Hammond MP said: 'This is great news for the people of Woolwich and the Royal Borough of Greenwich. A Crossrail station will provide significant opportunities for regeneration in the area, supporting jobs and growth and dramatically improving connectivity for people travelling between Woolwich and Canary Wharf, the City and the West End.'",
     "Mike Brown MVO, Managing Director of London Underground and Rail, said: 'This is a positive step forward and we are pleased work can now progress on the station which will open when the rest of the route through central London starts operating at the end of 2018 providing better connectivity with journeys times of just eight minutes to Canary Wharf and 15 minutes to Bond Street.'",
     "Councillor Chris Roberts, Leader of the Royal Borough of Greenwich, said 'The Royal Borough of Greenwich has worked for several years to ensure the Crossrail project includes a station at Woolwich.",

     "'It will unlock huge potential, secure better access to existing and emerging job markets for local residents and will stimulate inward investment in the town.",
     "'I am grateful to all those who worked with us to make sure this deal was secured.'",
     "John Anderson, Executive Director of Berkeley Homes, said: 'We have always been wholly committed to a Crossrail station within our flagship Royal Arsenal Riverside development and this is a vital step forward in the Crossrail project.",
