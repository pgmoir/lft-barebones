     "\u003cstrong\u003eGiorgio Casti\u003c/strong\u003e Vehicles must leave the depot in an almost military fashion each morning with any out of service vehicles promptly repaired. Giorgio is constantly aware of the need to avoid any delays for passengers and staff alike. He no sooner walks into the depot at 07:00 before the tools are out and vehicles are repaired and back in service. He takes great pride in the standards of repairs to 'his' vehicles and 'his' garage. Indeed, many visitors to the site comment on the tidiness and cleanliness of the garage area and store room. Giorgio often gets called out to assist drivers when vehicles have developed faults right at the end of his shift and will work over his rostered hours to provide a great service.",

His work in this area has become a benchmark in safely securing wheelchairs, helping to contribute to the development of a British Standard 'wheelchair passport' system which is currently being finalised.",

     "\u003cstrong\u003eJudges' Award for actions above and beyond the call of duty\u003c/strong\u003e The quick thinking of Dial-a-Ride driver Noreen helped to save three lives earlier this year in Havering when she was working a late shift. As she was dropping a passenger home she saw a car ahead of her in the traffic hit a parked car and then drive off. Noreen thought that the driver was behaving strangely and that something was not right. She decided to follow the car and noticed that there were two small children screaming and crying in the back. The car continued to weave across the road, cut corners and eventually hit a tree.",
     "Noreen raced from her vehicle and grabbed the keys of the car as the female driver was trying to restart the engine. While trying to calm the children, Noreen called the emergency services. When the police and ambulance arrived they told Noreen that the driver was seconds away from slipping into a diabetic coma and without her intervention there could have been fatal consequences.",
     "William put his Dial-a-Ride emergency first aid training to good use in September last year when he saved the life of an elderly Dial-a-Ride member who had a heart attack in the post office after being dropped off. William performed CPR until the ambulance arrived, with the ambulance driver remarking that the passenger would have died had it had not been for William's intervention. The passenger has now recovered and is back travelling with Dial-a-Ride.",
