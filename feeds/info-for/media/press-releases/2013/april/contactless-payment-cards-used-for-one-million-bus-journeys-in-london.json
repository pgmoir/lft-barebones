     "Shashi Verma, TfL's Director of Customer Experience, said: 'Paying for a bus fare should be as easy as buying a sandwich.

     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Contactless payment cards are debit, credit and charge cards that use contactless technology for small value payments. They are now being issued by banks for some Visa, MasterCard and American Express cards.

The easiest way to achieve this is for the customer to take the card they wish to pay with out of their wallet / bag and touch it on the reader.  When a contactless payment card and an Oyster card are presented simultaneously, bundled together in a wallet or purse for instance, the reader will reject the tap and no payment will be taken from either card. However, if a customer presented a wallet with two or more cards and there is a significant time gap before the second card is detected, this can result in the first card being charged which may not be the card the customer intended to pay with.  Any customer with queries about the fare they have paid should contact our Customer Services team on 0343 222 1234 or \\u003ca href=\\\"mailto:oysterenquiries@tfl.gov.uk\\\"\\u003eoysterenquiries@tfl.gov.uk\\u003c/a\\u003e \",\"London is leading the way globally with the introduction of contactless payments on the transport network, with cities all around the world expressing an interest in following London's lead in this field\",\"TfL will become one of the world's largest single merchants accepting contactless payments when the scheme is fully rolled out to all modes of transport\",\"Discussions are ongoing with the Train Operating Companies that serve London about accepting contactless payments on National Rail services where Oyster is currently accepted\\u003cbr /\\u003e\"]}"
