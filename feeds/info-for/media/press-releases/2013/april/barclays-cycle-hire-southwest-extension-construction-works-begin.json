     "The expansion of the scheme, which will open to the public in December 2013, will bring the highly successful Barclays Cycle Hire scheme to new areas within Wandsworth, Hammersmith \u0026 Fulham, Lambeth and Kensington \u0026 Chelsea.",
     "So far, users of the scheme have undertaken more than 20 million hires, helping to deliver the Mayor's vision of making London a truly cyclised city.",
     "The initial construction works involve installing electrical cables to bring power to the future docking points and terminals.",
     "Once the electrical works are completed, a black 'cycle hire' plate will be placed at the location, in preparation for the physical docking station to be installed later this year",
     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'The Barclays Cycle Hire scheme is going to be fantastic for southwest London.",
     "'It will be a real benefit to local people, it helps the economy and is key to my aim of making cycling an integral part of the Capital's transport network.'",
     "Nick Aldworth, General Manager for Barclays Cycle Hire, said: 'The expansion of Barclays Cycle Hire to southwest London will help create thousands of additional journeys each month.",
     "'Feedback from the public engagement sessions last year was extremely positive and we are now working hard to begin installing the infrastructure required to bring the Mayor's flagship Barclays Cycle Hire scheme to southwest London.'",
     "Ashok Vaswani, CEO Barclays Retail and Business Banking, said: 'We are delighted to have reached an important landmark for Barclays Cycle Hire as it makes such a positive difference to everyday life in London, its people and the economy.",
     "'Cycling continues to transform the Capital so we look forward to more Londoners and visitors becoming involved with the scheme as it extends to southwest London.'",
     "Barclays Cycle Hire already covers over 65km2 of the Capital stretching from Shepherd's Bush in the west, through central London and east to the fringes of the Olympic Park.",
     "The new area will increase the number of cycles available by more than 2,000 bicycles, helping to support a greater proportion of business and leisure journeys and encourage trial and take-up by a wider demographic.",
     "Work to deliver the expansion of Barclays Cycle Hire will be carried out by TfL's Central highways contractor who was selected through the TfL's new pan-London Highways Contract.",
     "Using these contracts will help provide a more sustainable and consistent approach to future docking station delivery across the Capital, ensuring better value for money and less disruption for Londoners.",
     "More than 100 potential locations have already been already approved for new Barclays Cycle Hire docking stations across London and around a further 150 are currently going through the planning process.",
     "New locations have been selected for consideration based on potentially cyclable journeys within the area, local attractions and proximity to key public transport connections.",
