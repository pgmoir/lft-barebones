     "'We would like to thank the local community for their feedback during this process and would ask local people for their patience while work to install the gates and staircase are being carried out.'",
     "Following feedback from the community and their council representatives, plans for the station were revised to maintain unrestricted pedestrian access across the footbridge. The platforms will be inaccessible from this segregated pedestrian route.",
     "Works are due to start on Monday 15 April, and are expected to be completed by mid-July 2013.",
     "The works will be conducted from 09:00 to 18:00 and will cause no disruption to train services or the travelling public. Free pedestrian access over the station will be maintained throughout the works.",
