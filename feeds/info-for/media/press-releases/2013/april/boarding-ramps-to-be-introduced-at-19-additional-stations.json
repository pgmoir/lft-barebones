     "Transport for London (TfL) today announced that boarding ramps - used to bridge the gap between platform and train at Tube stations - will be introduced to all remaining step-free stations where it's feasible to deploy them this summer.",
     "The ramps were retained at 16 Tube stations in September last year after their use during the 2012 Games and will now be introduced at an additional 40 platforms at 19 additional stations.",
     "Currently, 66 stations on the network are step-free from street to platform, but the gap between platform and train has meant that wheelchair and mobility scooter users can struggle to board.",
     "The new deployment of ramps will mean that, of the platforms that are currently accessible step-free from the street, 76 per cent (149 out of 195) will now be accessible to wheelchair and mobility scooter users through the use of the ramps, raised platform sections, low floor trains and other improvements.",
     "Introducing ramps to more of the Tube network was one of the commitments outlined in the mayor and TfL's 'Your Accessible Transport Network' document in December of last year.",
     "Progress on a number of other improvements outlined in the document was announced today as the Transport Commissioner, Sir Peter Hendy CBE, and Managing Director of London Underground, Mike Brown MVO, met with disabled people and disability organisations to discuss the programme. These include:",

This distinctive new accessibility signage, developed in conjunction with disabled people, is positioned at locations and heights that are easily viewable from wheelchairs. It provides better information about how best to navigate stations, including Westminster, Waterloo, Kings Cross and London Bridge\",\"A new Twitter feed @TfLAccess has been launched to give advice on getting the most out of the transport network,  to update disabled passengers on improvements to their services and to advise customers of any planned changes on the network - such as to lifts, escalators or stations - that may affect their journeys\",\"A world-leading customer information system has now been introduced on the entire Victoria line.

     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'London now has one of the most accessible public transport networks in the world. But it's not perfect and we must go further. That's why we're investing in imaginative solutions to make further improvements.",
     "'More boarding ramps and better signage, information and staff training, are concrete examples of our commitment to make the transport network as accessible as possible.'",
     "Mike Brown MVO, Managing Director of London Underground, said: 'Much of the Tube network dates back to an era where accessibility was not considered in the design of stations.",
     "'We are rectifying that - making 27 more Underground and London Overground stations step-free over the next eight years, and rebuilding key stations like Victoria and Tottenham Court Road.",
     "'But that work takes time, so in the shorter term we are making real improvements now - introducing  a huge range of smaller measures such as boarding ramps, platform humps and improved signage and staff training to make it easier for disabled customers to get around.'",
     "Tracey Lazard, Chief Executive, Inclusion London, said: 'Disabled and older passengers tell us that staff who are disability equality trained and confident to assist them make all the difference to a journey.",
     "'That's why Inclusion London and Transport for All are excited about this new initiative and we look forward to providing an enhanced level of training  to London Underground trainers and key staff at the five centres for excellence - developed in consultation with disabled and older Londoners who use the Tube and delivered by disabled trainers.'",
