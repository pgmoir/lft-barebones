     "In April 2009 routes 61, 273 and 661 were placed on diversion following the closure of Chislehurst Road bridge to buses.  As a result these routes were diverted to use Leesons Hill, Cray Avenue and Poverest Road.",
     "When the bridge reopened in 2012 a decision was made to return route 61 to its original roads whilst routes 273 and 661 continued to follow the diversion.",
     "When TfL analysed the results of this it found that good use was being made of the new links but a service also needed to be retained on Chislehurst Road.",
     "It was found that approximately 800 extra passengers per day were benefiting and making use of the changed routes.",
     "TfL proposes to make the current service patterns permanent and is seeking the views of local residents and passengers.",
