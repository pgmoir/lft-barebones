     "Depending on the scheme they are on, TfL graduates will spend up to three years as trainees working on projects such as the Bank Station upgrade, Barclays Cycle Hire, the Northern Line Extension and London Overground amongst many other TfL projects and services.",
     "Projects that they will be working on include contributing to the improvement of the reliability of the Tube and to making TfL's network more accessible for passengers.",

I was delighted when I found out that I'd been successful.",
     "'I've now been on my scheme forÂ two years and have had the opportunity to work on some amazing projects such as the Olympic Route Network and the Bond Street station upgrade.",
     "'I'm currently working on the expansion of Barclays Cycle Hire to southwest London and I'm really enjoying it.",

     "Many of these roles are in highly skilled disciplines and TfL and Crossrail have a vital role to play in ensuring these skills are maintained and developed into the future.",
     "It is estimated that Crossrail will generate at least 75,000 business opportunities and support the equivalent of 55,000 full time jobs right around the UK.",
     "Three out of five businesses currently winning work on the project are based outside London and over half (58 per cent) are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).",
