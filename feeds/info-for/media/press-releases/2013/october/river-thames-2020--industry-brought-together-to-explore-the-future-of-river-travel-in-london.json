     "Yesterday Richard Tracey, the Mayor's Ambassador for River Transport, and Transport for London brought together a number of large development companies, Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) and London boroughs for the first time to initiate discussions around the need for future investment in river passenger services.",
     "During the presentations and discussions delegates learnt more about the Mayor's £10m River Action Plan which includes significant investment in improving existing pier facilities and opening new piers in areas where there is potential for riverside development.",
     "The session highlighted the Mayor's ambitious plans to double passenger numbers on the Thames to 12 million by 2020, making it a major part of the capital's transport infrastructure which would help contribute to increased land values.",
     "The opportunity for businesses to invest in the Thames was discussed, and TfL highlighted the fact they are seeking new partnerships to maximise the potential for growth that the river offers London.",
     "River Bus and River Tour operators, including KPMG Thames Clippers and City Cruises, were also given the opportunity to set out their vision for the future, including the challenges they face and what support they need to continue the growth in passenger numbers seen in recent years.",
     "Richard Tracey, the Mayor's Ambassador for River Transport, said: 'The Mayor is determined to safeguard the river's central role in the future success of our great city.",
     "'That is why he has set a target to increase passenger journeys on the Thames to 12 million a year by 2020 and is investing £10m in improvements to stimulate growth.",
     "'We want to work with businesses to build on this commitment and make river travel an integral part of our transport network.",
     "'We are already making good progress in increasing passenger numbers, with new piers planned at Plantation Wharf and Battersea in the western section and Enderby Wharf in the east.'",
     "Andy Thompson, General Manager of London River Services, said: 'Since the launch of the River Action Plan we have seen renewed effort to maximise the use of the river Thames.",
     "'There is clearly widespread support for making greater use of the river and we look forward to working with potential commercial partners to deliver real improvements on the river and meet the Mayor's ambitious target.'",
     "The Director of the Mayor's Thames Festival, Adrian Evans, also spoke about the importance of delivering a whole host of leisure activities to reinforce the river's place at the heart of London life.",
