     "To mark the occasion Transport for London (TfL)Â is asking customers and staff to share their experiences and anecdotes for a new book to commemorate the anniversary.",
     "The Hammersmith \u0026 City line has seen great swathes of modernisation work over recent years to improve services for customers, including new and rebuilt stations, the doubling of train services along the line with the extension of the Circle line to Hammersmith, as well as the introduction of new walkthrough air-conditioned trains.",
     "Major interchanges have been overhauled, such as King's Cross St Pancras, which sees more passengers each year than Heathrow Airport.",
     "The station has been rebuilt and quadrupled in size, with better entrances and ticket halls to reduce congestion.",
     "Paddington Tube station is currently being rebuilt to prepare for more passengers with the link to Crossrail in 2018, and will have a new entrance, two new staircases, longer platforms and improved CCTV.",
     "Along the entire line, station platforms have been lengthened for the introduction of the new, longer S-Stock trains that are now operating.",
     "Peter Allaway, Hammersmith \u0026 City General Manager, said: 'In 2014 the Hammersmith \u0026 City branch between Paddington and Hammersmith will be celebrating its 150th anniversary.",
     "'The line is steeped in history and with train frequency doubling over the last few years, new walk-through trains being introduced and new and upgraded stations at Wood Lane and Paddington, it is becoming a key gateway to London.'",
     "TfL is asking customers and staff to send in their anecdotes, stories and photos of their experiences of the branch, whether it is their experiences of Notting Hill Carnival, in which the branch plays a key role, or a memorable journey to and from work.",
     "Posters about the competition will be going up on the network from Friday 27 September and the entry deadline for contributions to the book is the 31 December 2013.",
     "The book, which will be written by Mike Horne, will be published from June 2014.",
