     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Images available on request\",\"The Tube is undergoing a huge and essential programme to modernise its infrastructure and add vital extra capacity to cope with a growing population and to support the economic development and growth of the capital and the UK. This includes the introduction of new track and signalling and the rebuilding of some of our most important stations. TfL is working hard to provide information and alternative travel options while work is taking place. The work is essential to provide for London's growing transport needs now, and into the future. TfL is urging all Londoners and Tube, London Overground, London Tramlink and DLR passengers to \\\"check before you travel\\\" at weekends, allowing extra journey time where necessary.
