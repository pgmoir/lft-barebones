     "'The UITP aims to create joined up thinking across the globe to deliver successful urban transport systems and we can learn from other cities as well as share our knowledge of London and the successes we have already delivered, and are committed to continue to deliver, for the benefit of the Capital and indeed the whole country.'",
     "Huge improvements have been made to the transport network including completing the London Overground orbital network, completion of the Victoria and Jubilee line upgrades, increasing capacity on the Docklands Light Railway and the roll out of the New Bus for London.",
     "Work on constructing Crossrail continues at a pace with services due to be running through central London from the end of 2018, TfL has also been consulting on a route for Crossrail 2 which would link the south west of the capital with the north east.",
     "The Mayor's Roads Task Force has also been set up and has developed a vision for 21st century investment in London's roads, streets and urban realm.",
     "With London's population expected to grow to more than 10 million by the early 2030s investment in continued transport improvements as well as providing new infrastructure is vital in order to be able to support this growth.",
     "Investment in London's transport network supports 40,000 jobs in the UK supply chain, with a further 19,000 supported in the supply chain within London."
