TfL advises passengers who are feeling ill on a train to get off at the next stop rather than to pull the alarm mid journey.Â  It is better to treat ill people on a station where it is quicker and easier to get professional help. Alongside this it avoids risking many thousands of people being stuck on trains behind which are temporarily stopped while the alarm is pulled\",\"Holding the doors open and not moving down the carriage slows down trains leaving stations causing delays for thousands of people. Changing actions such as these can reduce the wait for passengers at the next station and along the line\"]}",

     "'While we are making improvements across the network, passengers can also play a key role in helping us to deliver an even more efficient service. Some 400 hours of delays last year could have been avoided with just a few small changes to customer travelling habits.",
     "'Littering, pulling the passenger alarm, holding the doors open and not letting passengers off the train are small actions that cause larger effects on the transport network. The campaign uses poetry as a way to advise our customers on simple steps they can take to help reduce incidents that delay services and impact upon everyone.'",
