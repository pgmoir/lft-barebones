     "Options include the Silvertown Tunnel - a new road tunnel running underneath the River Thames to connect the Royal Docks with the Greenwich Peninsula and the Gallions Reach Ferry - a vehicle ferry connecting Thamesmead and Beckton.",
     "The Silvertown Tunnel would relieve pressure on the Blackwall Tunnel and would not have height restrictions - helping to alleviate Blackwall Tunnel closures caused by over-height vehicles trying to enter.",
     "The proposed vehicle ferry would provide a river crossing linking Beckton directly with Thamesmead at Gallions Reach.",
     "It could replace the Woolwich Ferry, offering a better frequency of service and increased capacity.",

The last Road Show will be held at Barking Learning Centre on 19 January from 10am to 4pm\",\"Since the consultation began further documents have been added to the website. The first is a report on the results of the previous February 2012 river crossings consultation, the second is a summary of evidence concerning the need for intervention to improve the highway infrastructure in the area, and the third document outlines how TfL selected the options being consulted on. Anyone who has already responded to the consultation can still add further comments if they would like to\",\"Some respondents to the last river crossings consultation suggested alternative options for river crossings. One was improving the Woolwich Ferry rather than replacing it. Although this option would be cheaper and quicker than a new ferry it would not resolve the traffic congestion at the ferry terminals, which currently impacts heavily on the local area. It would also require the Woolwich Ferry to close while the new replacement infrastructure was constructed. Another option suggested was a bridge or tunnel at Gallions Reach rather than a ferry. If a ferry was constructed it would still be possible to implement a bridge or tunnel later or an alternative approach might be to construct a bridge or tunnel rather than a ferry.  However a bridge or tunnel would be more expensive and would take four years longer to deliver and  a significant amount of money would have to be spent on maintaining the ageing Woolwich Ferry in the meantime\",\"There are six times as many road crossings to the west of Tower Bridge compared to the east. This imbalance has disadvantaged firms which regularly need to travel in east London\",\"TfL received nearly 4,000 responses to the initial consultation in February 2012, and over 90 per cent of those who responded agreed there is a need for more river crossings in east and south east London. TfL used the responses to develop the proposals further and opened a second phase of the consultation in October 2012 the public and stakeholders are encouraged to provide further comments as soon as possible as the consultation will close on 1 February 2013\\u003cbr /\\u003e\"]}"
