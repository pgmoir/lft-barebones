     "The new bus emits less than half the CO2 and NOx of a current diesel bus.",
     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'I am thrilled to confirm that route 24 will be the first in London to be converted to run an entire fleet of these world leading new buses, which will be the cleanest and greenest of their kind.",

     "'We are now introducing more and more of them as we build and expand the biggest hybrid bus fleet in Europe.",
     "'But it's not just about the technology - I'm sure passengers on the route 24 will also be delighted with the ease of access and the iconic and spacious design, which echoes the best elements of London's bus heritage.'",
     "The buses are manufactured by Wrightbus in Northern Ireland which won a contract in 2009 to build eight prototypes with an option to produce the first 1,000 vehicles.",
     "Many components of the new bus, including engines, chassis, superstructure and seats, are manufactured in the UK.",
     "As well as illustrating the UK's engineering prowess, the order to produce large numbers of these bespoke vehicles will create jobs and help stimulate the UK economy.",
