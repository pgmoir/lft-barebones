     "The link, which was opened by the Mayor Boris Johnson and the Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin on 9 December 2012, completed the London Overground orbital network.",
     "The last orbital rail network built in London was London Underground's Circle Line, opened 128 years ago.",
     "Transport for London's (TfL) Chief Operating Officer for Rail, Howard Smith, said: 'The popularity of the new service across South London is as we expected given that it connects the major interchange of Clapham Junction in the west with the developing area of East London.",

     "The new tables measure the number of trains arriving within 59 seconds of schedule and London Overground had 88.4 per cent of its trains arriving within that time.",
     "'These two sets of figures reveal that London Overground is the most punctual and popular railway in the UK and provides the sort of rail service Londoners deserve,' said Mr Smith.",

     "The one millionth passenger travelled at around 2pm.",
     "The London Overground network overall carried 160,000 passengers on one of its busiest days yet.",
     "Almost 120 million people use the London Overground network annually and based on the first month's figure the new Clapham Junction to Surrey Quays link is expected to add around 13 to 14 million passengers per annum.",
