     "On the 10th anniversary of the LowCVP, TfL was recognised with a special award for Outstanding Achievement in Low Carbon Transport over the last decade.",
     "The judges praised TfL as a world-leader in this area, noting the expansion of its hybrid bus fleet, supporting the take-up of hydrogen and electric vehicles, and the introduction of the Congestion Charge and the Low Emission Zone.",
     "TfL has worked hard to reduce the environmental impact of its 8,500 strong bus fleet by trialling innovative new technologies, like hydrogen, and increasing the number of hybrid buses.",
     "The hybrid fleet is set to reach 1,600 vehicles by 2016 - including 600 new bus for London vehicles, which are the most environmentally friendly bus of their kind and emit half the NOx and CO2 of diesel buses.",
     "TfL's second award was the accolade of Low Carbon Heavy Duty Vehicle Manufacturer of the Year, with Wrightbus, for the new bus for London.",
     "The judges for this category noted that as well as being stunning, original and passenger friendly, the bus also has impressive environmental credentials.",
     "Mike Weston, London Buses Operations Director, said: 'We're delighted that the work over the past decade in trialling and adopting lower carbon vehicles and striving to reduce emissions has been recognised with this outstanding achievement award.",
     "'TfL has worked consistently in this area and in doing so has built the largest hybrid bus fleet in Europe, trialled innovative new technologies like hydrogen and developed the new bus for London, which is an industry leader in emissions terms.",
     "'We will continue to monitor other technologies that could help us to deliver greater benefits, in line with the Mayor's commitment to cutting CO2 emissions and improving air quality in the capital.\"",
     "David Barnett, Wrightbus Product Director, said: 'We are thrilled to have our work in developing the new bus for London further acknowledged with such a prestigious award.",
     "'Our aim for the project was to create a truly innovative and green vehicle that redefines the icon, making it fit for modern day London.",
     "'Along with our partners on the project, we have clearly successfully achieved this, with eight vehicles currently in daily service, and a further 600 set for delivery over the next few years.'",
