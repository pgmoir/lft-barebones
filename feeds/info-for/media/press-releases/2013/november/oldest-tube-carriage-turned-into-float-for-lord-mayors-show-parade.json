     "Over half a million people are expected to line the streets of the City of London for the Lord Mayor's Show to witness a pageant of colour.",
     "The carriage and its passengers will be travelling alongside a carnival of horses and carts, marching bands, vintage cars, giant robots, helicopters, tractors, penny farthings and the magnificent Gold State Coach belonging to the Mayor and Aldermen.",
     "Transport for London supports Railway Children's fight for children living on the streets and London Transport Museum's educational charitable work and will use this special day to highlight the great work of both of these organisations.",
     "Metropolitan Railway carriage No. 353 formed part of the heritage steam train that ran at the start of this year on the Tube's current network for London Underground's 150th anniversary celebrations.",
     "It was brought back to life with funds from London Transport Museum Friends and the Heritage Lottery fund.",
     "Mike Brown MVO, Managing Director of London Underground and London Rail, said: 'I can't wait to see this beautifully restored carriage travelling along the streets of the City of London to celebrate the 150th anniversary of London Underground.",
     "'The Tube has always played an important role in the economic development of the London and UK economy so it seems fitting that we should take part in a festival in one of the world's major financial centres.",
     "'We've supported Railway Children for many years. Sharing a float with the charity at the Lord Mayor's Show is an excellent way to highlight how the organisation is helping to transform the lives of children living on the streets.'",
     "David Maidment, Founder Ambassador at Railway Children, said: 'Transport for London has supported Railway Children for a number of years, through various fundraising and staff activities. Their continued support and commitment is crucial to our work with vulnerable children living on the streets. We are extremely grateful to be part of today's celebrations and the opportunity to raise awareness of our work.'",
     "Sam Mullins, Chief Executive at London Transport Museum, said: 'I am delighted that we are playing a part in this ancient and much loved procession which gives us the opportunity to display Carriage 353 to millions of people. It has had a chequered history - as a farm outbuilding, a tailor's workshop and a clubhouse for American servicemen. So it's wonderful to think that we have rescued it from obscurity and that it is now featuring in one of London's traditional events.'",
     "People can still experience steam train travel on London Underground with London Transport Museum; the next opportunity to ride on the sumptuous Jubilee carriage 353 will be on Sunday 8 December when it will be part of a public steam event running between Harrow-on-the-Hill and Uxbridge.",

     "One of the ways TfL supports the Railway Children charity is through the Oyster card donation scheme.",
     "Customers are able to leave an Oyster card that they no longer want or need at collection points at Heathrow Terminal 4 (2 boxes), Liverpool Street and King's Cross St. Pancras Tube stations and the unused credit and card deposit is donated to the charity.",
     "An average of £25,000 per year is raised through this scheme and last year, £52,000 was raised due to the extra footfall created by the London Olympics and Paralympics.",
     "Additional TfL, including LU and London Overground, activities and fundraising have also helped to raise more than £75,000 for Railway Children in the last year.",
     "People can also donate to a project that London Transport Museum is running to restore a B-type bus to its Western front condition as part of the commemoration of the Centenary of the First World War.
