     "We're clear that there'll be a job for everyone at LU who wants to work for us and be flexible, that we'll make these changes with no compulsory redundancies, and that we'll involve staff in our plans at every stage and support them through change.",
     "Transport for London (TfL) has responded to the announcement this morning that unions are to ballot their members on London Underground (LU) in response to plans unveiled last week to run parts of the Tube for 24 hours at weekends during 2015, and to make staff more visible at stations.",
     "The plans, announced by the Mayor and LU Managing Director Mike Brown on Thursday 21 November, will see a 24 hour 'Night Tube' introduced on five lines during 2015, with more staff visible and available at stations to help customers buy the right ticket, plan their journeys and keep them safe and secure.",
     "Phil Hufton, London Underground's Chief Operating Officer, said: 'People are at the heart of our vision for the future of the Tube - our customers and staff - and we've made a series of clear commitments about how we'll introduce these changes.",
     "'We've promised customers that we'll introduce a 24 hour Tube service on five lines during 2015, and our commitment is that all Tube stations will remain staffed at all times when services are operating.Â  In future there'll be more staff in ticket halls and on gatelines to help customers buy the right ticket and keep them safe and secure.",
     "'We're clear that there'll be a job for everyone at LU who wants to work for us and be flexible, that we'll make these changes with no compulsory redundancies, and that we'll involve staff in our plans at every stage and support them through change.",
     "'We are now consulting with our unions and staff on our future vision, and I would urge the unions to work with us to shape our plans, rather than threaten hard-working Londoners with completely unnecessary strike action.'"
