     "Following the helicopter crash in Vauxhall on 16 January, Transport for London (TfL), its contractors, the emergency services and Brookfield Multiplex, the construction company whose crane was damaged in the incident, have been working hard to carry out repairs and reinstate normal operation of the roads as quickly as possible.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eConstructing a crane of this size and nature is a slow and intricate process which severe weather can have a huge effect on progress.",
     "Due to recent high winds, some of which have reached in excess of 35 kilometres per hour, and heavy fog around the Vauxhall area, Brookfield Multiplex's work to repair the 190m crane on St Georges Tower took longer than originally planned and will now be completed this weekend.",
     "This has meant that there will be no access to Vauxhall Bridge and restricted access to the Vauxhall gyratory this weekend to remove the 800 tonne temporary crane and allow the road network to become fully reopened.",
     "During the closure, diversions will be temporarily reinstated to direct traffic away from the area and drivers informed through a range of channels, including via the TfL website, Twitter feeds and on-street signs.",
     "London Underground and National Rail services through Vauxhall Station and the Vauxhall bus station will continue to operate as normal across the weekend.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLeon Daniels, Managing Director of Surface Transport at TfL, said:",
     "`Our staff and contractors continue to work to minimise disruption to people travelling through the Vauxhall area following the recent terrible incident.",
     "`While I can appreciate the frustration that local businesses and road users have felt about these prolonged road closures, the nature of these works meant that they need to be carried out with the highest level of safety.",
     "`The part closure of the Vauxhall Gyratory this weekend will allow the final phase of works to be carried out and we continue to work around the clock to allow these roads to be fully reopened as quickly and as safely as possible.`",
     "Up to the minute travel information is available on the TfL website or by following @tfltravelalerts, @tfltrafficnews and @tflbusalerts on Twitter.\u003cbr /\u003e"
