     "Following London Underground's (LU's) modernisation of the Victoria line, which has seen the introduction of new signalling and trains, delays to customers have been reduced by a third in four years.",
     "The upgrade has delivered a 33 trains per hour service and is giving customers faster and more reliable journeys.",
