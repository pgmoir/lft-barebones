     "Fares across Transport for London (TfL) services will now rise by less than RPI on average - 2.7 per cent - in 2014 and will come into effect on Sunday 19 January 2014.",
     "The amendment to previously announced fare changes follows the announcement by HM Government that National Rail (NR) fares have been held down to RPI only on average from the new year.",
     "No fares for TfL services will increase from those previously announced on 3 December, which means when factoring in the NR Travelcard fares, the average increase for London now represents a less than RPI increase.",
     "Due to the timing of the Government's announcement and the need to implement a revised set of fares, the new TfL and London Travelcard fares will come into effect from Sunday 19 January 2014.",
     "Customers will be able to purchase tickets at 2013 prices until 18 January 2014.",
     "All Train Operators' fare changes for travel within London will also be introduced from 19 January.",
     "TfL's revised Business Plan sets out how £16bn of efficiencies and savings are being made across TfL to support the billions of pounds of investment in transport infrastructure over the next ten years.",
     "TfL will continue to identify and make savings and efficiencies that will keep fares down as well as developing the commercial strategy to meet revenue targets.",
     "The key elements of the January 2014 fares package are:",
