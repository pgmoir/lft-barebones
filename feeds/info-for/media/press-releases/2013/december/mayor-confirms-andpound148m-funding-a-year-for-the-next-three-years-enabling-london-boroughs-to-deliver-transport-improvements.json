     "'Safer cycling routes and better open spaces not only make our city safer but they also boost local economies encouraging people to support their local high streets.'",
     "The boroughs are also benefitting from measures introduced by TfL last year to help them keep costs down, provide value for money and keep the disruption of road and construction works to a minimum.",
