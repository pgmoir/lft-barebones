     "If there is no signal available at the location, the app defaults to the Cabwise text messaging service (60835).",
     "Alternatively users can visit. \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/cabwise\"\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk/cabwise\u003c/a\u003e on their smart phone and simply bookmark the page.",

     "I want to encourage passengers travelling on New Year's Eve to make sure they plan ahead for their journey home.",
     "They can either make use of the free travel being provided on our services sponsored by Diageo, or if taking a taxi they should make sure it is a black cab or a pre-booked minicab.'",
     "Andrew Cowan, Country Director, Diageo Great Britain said: 'Our brands are synonymous with celebration - and what bigger celebration is there than New Year's Eve? We want everyone to enjoy themselves and we want to make sure everyone can get home safely.",
     "'We've had two great years partnering with TfL and this year we're launching our Grumpy Gorilla to remind people to have fun - but to be careful and think while they drink.'",

     "The online Festive Travel Guide lists these closures \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/festive\"\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk/festive\u003c/a\u003e .",
     "Night buses and 24 hour routes will also be operating; some routes may be on diversion due to road closures in central London.",
