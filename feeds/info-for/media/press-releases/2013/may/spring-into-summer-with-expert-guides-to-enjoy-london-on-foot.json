     "With summer trying its best to arrive it can only mean one thing; time to enjoy London on foot.",
     "Join in one of 35 free guided walks taking place across London this weekend on Saturday 25 May and Sunday 26 May.",
     "The Mayor and Transport for London (TfL) are sponsoring free walks with expert guides to help Londoners enjoy the bustling sights and sounds as well as the changing landscape of the capital.",
     "This weekend's walks will help people appreciate how easy and enjoyable it is to walk around our great city.",
     "Known as 'Spring into Summer weekend', the walks help Londoners discover the richness of landmarks in central London and the wealth of parks, rivers, canals, open spaces and hidden gems across the capital, with something suitable for all ages and abilities.",
     "All walks are accompanied by a trained walk leader and experienced 'back marker' who ensures the rear of the group is not left behind.",
     "The Mayor, TfL and London Boroughs are working to transform London to make it a city that is easier and more pleasurable to enjoy on foot.",
     "A number of things are happening to achieve this, including new and improved public spaces, better walking routes that link places people walk to, and more routes away from traffic.",
     "In the run up to the London 2012 Games TfL opened 40 new Greenways which are traffic-free paths to encourage walking and those learning or returning to cycling, and completed the Walk London Network of walking routes.",
     "Earlier this year during another guided walking weekend known as Winter Wanders 3,464 people took advantage of the free walks on offer.",
     "Ben Plowden, Director of Surface Planning at TfL, said: 'The amazing turnout of both runners and the cheering crowds at the Marathon in London last month is testimony of the great London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics Games legacy, during which a number of people varied how they travelled to and from venues, including walking.",
     "'We are urging people to build on that by exploring London this weekend and putting a spring in their step by joining in one of the free guided walks happening across the capital.'",
     "Anne Clark, Walk England Managing Director, said: 'The walks offer the perfect way to explore London and discover places and the stories associated with them.",
     "'The enthusiasm and knowledge of the guides really brings the capital to life for locals and visitors alike.",
     "'May is one of the best times to walk, and with so many different walks to choose from we're confident there really is something for everyone this weekend.'",
     "The Spring into Summer weekend is organised by Walk England and funded by TfL. To find out more about the walks near you visit \u003ca href=\"http://www.walklondon.org.uk\"\u003ewww.walklondon.org.uk\u003c/a\u003e ",
