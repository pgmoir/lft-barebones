     "As National Apprenticeship Week begins, TfL has launched the second phase of its annual search for fresh talent to help London keep moving and growing.",
     "Seventy-five new apprenticeships at Level 2 \u0026 3 have been launched in disciplines ranging from Building Surveying and Transport Planning, to Track and Signals for London Underground (LU).",
     "TfL's apprenticeships offer a wide range of opportunities for people to kick-start a career in their chosen field.",
     "Apply here: \u003ca href=\"https://careers.tfl.gov.uk/category/apprenticeships/\"\u003ehttps://careers.tfl.gov.uk/category/apprenticeships/\u003c/a\u003e ",
     "It's never too late to change careers and TfL's apprenticeships are open to people of all ages. After completing the first level of their apprenticeship, some schemes offer individuals the chance to study for a degree as part of their apprenticeship - meaning they can gain industry experience and a university education.",

     "In the Apprentice meets the Apprentice film (available to view \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/hrA_ed3wy9s\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e ), LU Track Engineering Nura Abukar meets Harry Joseph, a former TfL Finance apprentice. Three years after completing his apprenticeship he is now a Finance Business Manager.",
     "TfL is holding a number of events to celebrate its apprenticeship programmes and raise awareness of TfL's opportunities. There will be a chance to speak to current apprentices, their managers and TfL's recruitment team.",
     "This will be a chance to find out more information about what's on offer and the recruitment process, which can increase the chances of being successful. The Level 3 Apprenticeships event takes place on 14 February and an event specifically focusing on apprenticeships in London Underground on 22 February.",
     "It's important that TfL has a diverse workforce that is reflective of the city that it serves and TfL has been working hard to attract a diverse range of candidates to its apprenticeship schemes, particularly to engineering roles.",
     "Between 2018 and 2019, the number of women recruited to TfL apprenticeship schemes increased by 17% to 37% of apprenticeship hires.",
     "TfL has also been successful in recruiting more women and people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds specifically to London Underground engineering apprenticeship schemes, with 50% of LU apprentices recruited in 2019 being from a BAME background and 18% women.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Better for everyone\"}",
     "Since 2009, TfL, Crossrail, their suppliers and the London Transport Museum have employed more than 8,750 apprentices. They have worked on vital infrastructure projects including the modernisation of key Tube stations, the construction of the Northern line extension, and the redesign of London's road junctions to make them safer and better for everyone.",
     "TfL also works with the London Transport Museum to support those who have completed its Route into Work programme to gain access to apprenticeships.",
     "The programme supports young people between 16 and 25, who are not in education, employment or training to gain and improve employability skills, such as teamwork and confidence building, which can help them overcome potential barriers to employment.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eTricia Wright, Chief People Officer at TfL, said:\u003c/strong\u003e 'TfL is driven by a passionate and skilled workforce who continue to keep our city moving and evolving - making life better for millions of people every day.",
     "'We're looking for inquisitive, enthusiastic individuals who reflect London's diversity to join our apprenticeship programme in a range of areas, such as engineering, signalling and project controls.",
     "'You don't need to be an expert in transport already - as long as you want to learn new skills and make a positive impact on people's lives in London every day, you'll fit right in.'",
