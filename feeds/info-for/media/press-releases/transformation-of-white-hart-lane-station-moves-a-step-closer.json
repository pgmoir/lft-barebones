     "The major transformation of White Hart Lane station to make it more accessible and improve journeys for customers moved closer today as Transport for London (TfL) announced Taylor Woodrow, part of VINCI Construction UK, as the successful bidder to design and rebuild the station by spring 2019.",
     "TfL and Taylor Woodrow will work together to redevelop the station, which is used by 1.3m customers a year, delivering improvements including a new ticket hall and station entrance as well step-free access from street to platform for the very first time.",
     "The redevelopment directly supports the regeneration in the area, which includes plans for the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, a museum, hotel and 585 new homes, as well as 2,000 homes as part of the High Road West masterplan and a further 3,000 homes in the wider North Tottenham area.",
     "Improvements will include:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"A new ticket hall located at the centre of the platforms on Love Lane, creating a better connection with Tottenham High Road\",\"A new additional entrance providing access to Penshurst Road for the first time\",\"Two new lifts delivering step-free access from the street to platform\",\"Direct access from the new ticket hall to provide more central access to platforms, reducing bottlenecks and meaning passengers can move between the street and trains more quickly\",\"A new station forecourt to greatly improve the public realm on Love Lane, creating a better and safer environment for pedestrians and cyclists.\",\"New cycle parking, improved CCTV and Legible London wayfinding to help people continue their journeys on foot\"]}",
     "Jon Fox, TfL's Director for London Rail, said:",
     "`White Hart Lane station is set for a radical transformation to make life easier and more comfortable for customers. The station will see lifts installed for the first time, making it more accessible for everyone, and the new entrance will provide better connections with the local area, supporting the new homes and jobs being created in Tottenham.'",
     "Jez Haskins, Taylor Woodrow's TfL Sector Director, said:",
     "`Taylor Woodrow are pleased to be delivering what will become a new landmark station for TfL, which will benefit from the skills and expertise that we have gained in station upgrades at Victoria and Tottenham Court Road.  We look forward to working with TfL and all of the local stakeholders to successfully transform White Hart Lane station.'",
     "Work is expected to start on site in autumn 2017, with the improvements complete in spring 2019.  The station will be available for fans travelling to and from the stadium when it opens in summer 2018 as it will continue to operate throughout the majority of the improvement works. TfL will be introducing brand new trains on the London Overground route through White Hart Lane station to replace the existing trains which are now over 30 years old.",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Artist impressions of the new station are available \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tflpress/albums/72157673587906392\\\"\\u003ehere \\u003c/a\\u003e \",\"The contract value is Â£17.8m with a copy of this available on request.
