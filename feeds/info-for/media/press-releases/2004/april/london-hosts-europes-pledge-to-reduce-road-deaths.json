     "\"The statistics are horrendous, but the individual stories of pain and tragedy are far, far worse. London has to wake up to the reality of nearly six people a week being killed on our roads. It is a situation which we would never accept on the railways, or tube. We have doubled the money spent on 20mph zones and we need to spend even more on the measures which will know will cut road deaths. These deaths and injuries are not just individual twists of fate, but preventable acts of social neglect.\"",

     "\"280 people were killed on London's roads in 2002. We are deeply committed to working with the boroughs, police and schools to reduce this figure. The UK already has the best road safety record in Europe but we still need to work hard to lower the numbers hurt and killed on our Capital's roads. \"",

Concerned about the number of accidents and injuries occurring on our roads, they have decided to join forces and launch the SAFE Campaign.
