     "Vehicle checks will start on Thursday 8th April and from early June 2004 private hire vehicles will have to meet strict safety standards to trade legally, by either holding a license or a temporary permit from the Public Carriage Office (PCO).",
     "A distinctive new disc fixed to front and rear windscreens will identify the vehicle as a licensed private hire vehicle.",
     "Mayor Ken Livingstone said:",
     "\"The start of licensing private hire vehicles completes the final stage of regulation to make minicab travel in London safer. Passengers deserve to travel in safe, roadworthy and clean cars, which cannot be confused with black cabs. These new strict standards will improve the quality of service for passengers and make travelling in minicabs safer for Londoners. By April 2005, all existing private hire vehicles will be licensed.\"",
     "\"This follows the successful licensing of some 2,300 private hire operators and the start of licensing for 43,000 drivers. It's vital that we rid London of illegal taxi touts and build on work to improve late night travel, which has included increasing the number of night buses and back cabs and provide a police presence and CCTV on night buses.\"",
     "Licensed Private Hire Car Association Chairman Steve Wright said:",
     "\"Vehicle Licensing brings the private hire industry much closer to completing the task of delivering a fully regulated minicab and chauffeur industry in London.\"",
     "\"The introduction of private hire vehicles licensed by TfL will improve safety and give the travelling public the ability to book a private hire vehicle with the same confidence as they would a licensed taxi.\"",
     "\"Now that it will be a requirement for all licensed private hire vehicles to have an identity disc in windscreens, illegal touts will be easier to isolate and prosecute.\"",
     "\"The LPHCA welcomes the new TfL regulations as good news for Londoners.\"",
     "The checks are similar to those carried out traditionally for black cabs. Examiners will be ensuring that the vehicles are safe, mechanically sound, comfortable and fit for the purpose of carrying passengers. The new standards will include:",
