     "This summer, the number of cyclists in London has soared to its highest level since Transport for London (TfL) was created, a new TfL report will show. Despite the poor weather, the bicycle boom has continued its upward trend, with a year on year increase of 23% between the May/June of 2003 and 2004."

     "This increase, to be announced at a TfL Business Management Review meeting, shows an increase on the roads managed by Transport for London, the Transport for London Road Network (TLRN). However, the increase is also reflected on the roads managed by boroughs throughout London, showing a comparable 19% increase for the same period.",
     "This increase is largely due to the improved road conditions due to increased investment in cycling measures promoted by the Cycle Centre of Excellence (CCE). The CCE has provided the following:",
     "\u003cbr /\u003eRose Ades, the Head of the Cycling Centre of Excellence, commented\u003cbr /\u003e\"These results show the benefits of TfL's new focus on cycling, and the programme of measures that have been introduced by the London boroughs and many other organisations. I am delighted that more and more Londoners are discovering the joys, and advantages, of city cycling.",

     "TfL has monitored cycling at 30 selected locations on the TLRN since March 2000 and since February 2003 at 35 locations on the BPRN.",
     "TfL's London Cycling Action Plan aims to achieve an 80% increase in cycling levels by 2010 and a 200% increase by 2020 compared to cycling levels in 2000. The targets set are based on analysis of the impact of positive cycle planning in other European cities.",
     "London's cyclists reflect the broad profile of Londoners as a whole. Though among adults the gender split is heavily weighted towards men (around 70/30) TfL research shows that the split is more equal for London's new cyclists.",
     "Figures provided in the Congestion Charging Second Annual Report show that the number of cycle-related accidents within the congestion charging zone had fallen between 2001 and 2003.",
     "In addition, figures provided to the TfL Board on 23 June stated that the number of cycle related deaths or serious injuries on the TLRN (Transport for London Road Network) have also fallen in the past year, despite the 23% increase.",
