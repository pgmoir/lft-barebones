     "Speaking at City Hall, the Mayor said:",
     "\"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reverse decades of under-investment in Hounslow and right across London. It marks an end to stop-start funding for London's transport. The programme will deliver real improvements in the services and capacity needed to keep passengers travelling in and through Hounslow on the move.\"",
     "The main benefit for Hounslow included in TfL's 5 Year Investment Programme, subject to approval by the TfL Board, includes the modernisation of the Hounslow bus station to improve accessibility and increase capacity.",
     "In addition, the following improvements to District and Piccadilly Lines and stations are planned to be delivered under the PPP:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"station refurbishments and modifications to Turnham Green (completion 2005); Hounslow Central and Stamford Brook (2006); Hounslow West and Osterley (2007-2010);\",\"all 75 District Line trains to be refurbished by 2009 including space for wheelchairs, audio \\u0026 video info systems and refurbished seats and interiors.\"]}",
     "The Mayor added:",
     "\"The last five years have seen huge improvements in Hounslow's bus services. This investment programme will build on this and deliver improvements right across the transport network.",
     "\"We have had to take hard choices. Even with the biggest transport investment programme London has seen since the Second World War, we cannot do everything we want to do this time round. But there have been no trade-offs between maintaining the existing system or launching new projects.\"",
     "Work undertaken to improve transport in Hounslow by TfL over the past four years, benefiting all Londoners including those with disabilities and the socially excluded includes:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"more reliable services and better information on all bus services;\",\"new low floor, fully accessible buses on 29 routes and increased frequencies on 27 routes;\",\"the introduction of two new routes (272,440) and four night bus routes (N105, N27, N285 and N65);\",\"funding for additional Met police officers and police Community Support officers to reduce crime and the fear of crime, improve enforcement on and around bus routes and tackle taxi touting;\",\"licensing of private hire vehicles to improve passenger safety;\",\"funding for improving conditions for walking, cycling and road safety;\",\"improvements in dial-a-ride and taxicard funding.\"]}",
     "In partnership with the Borough a range of local schemes have or will shortly be implemented including:",
