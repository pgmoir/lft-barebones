     "\"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reverse decades of under-investment in Barnet and right across London. It marks an end to stop-start funding for London's transport. The programme will deliver real improvements in the services and capacity needed to keep passengers travelling in and through Barnet on the move.\"",

     "The Mayor added:",
     "\"The last four years have seen huge improvements in Barnet's bus services. This investment programme will build on this and deliver improvements right across the transport network.",
     "\"We have had to take hard choices. Even with the biggest transport investment programme London has seen since the Second World War, we cannot do everything we want to do this time round. But there have been no trade-offs between maintaining the existing system or launching new projects.\"",
     "Work undertaken to improve transport in Barnet by TfL over the past four years benefiting all Londoners, including those with disabilities and the socially excluded, includes:",
