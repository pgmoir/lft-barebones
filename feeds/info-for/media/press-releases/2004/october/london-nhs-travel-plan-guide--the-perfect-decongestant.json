     "The London NHS Travel Plan Good Practice Guide addresses the travel needs of staff, patients, visitors and contractors and offers a practical variety of travel options to help reduce congestion.",
     "The London Health Strategy, developed by the London Health Commission, has identified transport as one of four priority areas for action. The strategy acknowledges that the health sector has a substantial effect on transport in London because of the concentration of NHS hospitals, primary care facilities and research institutions.",
     "TfL's Principal Travel Advisor Patrick Allcorn said of the Guide; 'This Guide will show NHS staff and visitors that there are viable alternative travel options they can take to reduce congestion and improve their health.'",
     "The Government introduced the concept of travel plans a few years ago to focus attention on the need for better travel arrangements to large workplaces, such as hospitals and universities. Without concerted action to ensure that people have the opportunity to use alternatives to the car, where appropriate, the problems of congestion and parking will get progressively worse.",
     "By encouraging walking and cycling, car sharing where possible, and greater use of public transport, Travel Plans can help staff and visitors lessen the impact of traffic on the local community.",
     "Transport for London reports to the Mayor, Ken Livingstone and is responsible for maintaining and managing the 580km Transport for London Road Network (TLRN), which, although comprising only 5 per cent of the Capital's roads, carries approximately 33 per cent of its traffic.",
     "Transport for London is responsible for implementing the Mayor's Transport Strategy on improving the movement of people and goods on London's streets by helping pedestrians, cyclists, bus passengers and people with disabilities."
