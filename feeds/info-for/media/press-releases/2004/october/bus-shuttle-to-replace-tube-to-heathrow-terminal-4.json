     "Piccadilly line services will continue to run direct to and from central London to Heathrow Terminals 1, 2 \u0026 3 station. The change will mean a slightly increased journey time to Terminal 4 of five to ten minutes. But it will actually cut journey times by Tube to Heathrow Terminals 1, 2 \u0026 3 by a few minutes.",
     "Piccadilly line General Manager, Mike Challis said:\u003cbr /\u003e\"Around 2,500 people travel to and from Terminal 4 by Tube each day. We will have a dedicated bus shuttle service in place that means those journeys will only take about five minutes longer than now.",

It includes amending the world-famous Tube map, providing leaflets at stations and special Tube driver and station announcements. Extra staff will be on hand at Hatton Cross to help passengers.",
     "Any passengers travelling to and from Terminal 4 who may have difficulty using the stairs at Hatton Cross should travel to Heathrow Terminals 1, 2 \u0026 3 and use the free Heathrow Express Service to reach Terminal 4.

A full replacement bus service will be in operation, with more information to be issued nearer the time.",
