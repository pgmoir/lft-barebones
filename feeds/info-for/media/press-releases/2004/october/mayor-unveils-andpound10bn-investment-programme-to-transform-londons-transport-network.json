The programme will deliver the real improvements in the services and capacity needed to keep London on the move. Over the next four years we will be extending the kind of improvements we have already made to London bus services to the Tube.",

Real and lasting improvements are on the way. The Mayor and TfL are to be congratulated on making hard choices and presenting a solid vision of London in terms of transport.",

     "\"The last five years have seen huge improvements in London's bus services. This investment programme will build on those and deliver improvements right across the transport network.",
     "\"We have had to take hard choices, including raising fares to help repay the costs of borrowing for investment. Even with the biggest transport investment programme London has seen since the Second World War, we cannot do everything we want to do this time round. But in addition to the huge investment we are making, London will also benefit from the major east-west rail link Crossrail, which is now moving forward. We are continuing to negotiate with government over funding for this essential scheme.\"",
