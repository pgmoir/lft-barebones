     "\"The last four years have seen huge improvements in Barking and Dagenham's bus services. This investment programme will build on this and deliver improvements right across the transport network.",
     "\"We have had to take hard choices. Even with the biggest transport investment programme London has seen since the Second World War, we cannot do everything we want to do this time round. But there have been no trade-offs between maintaining the existing system or launching new projects.\"",
