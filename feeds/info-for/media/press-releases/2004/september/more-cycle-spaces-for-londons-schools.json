The London Cycle Action Plan published by TfL earlier this year set out bold targets including a 200 per cent increase in cycling by 2020 and 5,000 new cycle spaces installed by the end of 2005.",

     "\"I'm delighted at the success of this project and the enthusiastic support of the boroughs and schools. Secure and good quality cycle parking is a key element in delivering the Mayor's Cycling Action Plan. Getting children out of their parents' cars and on to their bikes is not only good for their health, but will also help improve London's environment, and help free-up our roads.",
     "\"It's great to see so many schools now properly geared up for the future and I'm confident that this initiative, combined with TfL's commitment to cycle training, will help parents, teachers and children to view cycling as a safe, affordable and viable option for school travel.\"",

However the level of cycling in London is relatively low compared to many other European cities. Targeting children and young people will help to reduce the number of unnecessary short car journeys and with the availability of new cycle parking facilities, cycling will now be a viable alternative to driving\",\"A 23% increase in the number of cycle journeys has been witnessed on the Transport for London Road Network in the past year.\"]}",
