     "Designed to improve security at these Hayes Line stations, as well as compliment security on Hayes Line trains, the station interchange improvements will enable monitoring of lines across the South Eastern Trains (SET) franchise area to be co-ordinated from the SET headquarters. New CCTV cameras, public address systems and improved lighting at all four stations proposed by the LBB, SET and Bromley Community Police will begin installation in Autumn 2004 with completion of the £100,000 project expected in March 2005.",
     "Barry Broe, TfL Director of Group Transport Planning \u0026 Policy said:",
     "\"I'm delighted that TfL are able to continue to improve London's transport facilities through work with our local authority partners. This funding from TfL will mean rail passengers at Hayes Line stations will benefit from improved station security\".",
     "Station improvements are an important part of TfL's commitment to the delivery of the Mayor's Transport Strategy for London. On-going enhancements to key interchange stations contribute to the better integration of the buses, tube, rail and trams enabling potential increases both in the efficiency of the network and the number of passengers carried.",
     "Works will be carried out by the LBB who will receive the TfL grant via South East London Transport Strategy (SELTRANS). SELTRANS was established in 1998 with the principle objective of improving London's transport integration and is a London sub-regional partnership between the seven southeast London boroughs of Bexley, Bromley, Croydon, Greenwich, Lambeth, Lewisham and Southwark, transport providers and operators, and groups representing the interests of businesses and passengers.",
     "TfL's interchange station funding is intended to enable local Borough councils to undertake improvements to trains, services and stations, in addition to work carried out by the regional Train Operating Companies (TOCs) and follows the allocation of £387,000 by TFL in 2003/2004 for similar improvements at eight station interchanges.",
     "In 2004/2005 at least six key South London interchange stations will benefit from similar station improvements: Earlsfield, Tulse Hill, Hayes, West Wickham, Eden Park and Norwood Junction.",
     "In 2004/2005 TfL will award a total of £147 million through Borough Spending Plan (BSP) applications, submitted by the Boroughs to fund a range of local transport improvements. Over £4m of this funding will go to improve station access facilities through this and other TfL initiatives.",
     "Further funding applications for similar projects are expected to be submitted by the Boroughs through the BSP process for the financial year 2005/2006.",
