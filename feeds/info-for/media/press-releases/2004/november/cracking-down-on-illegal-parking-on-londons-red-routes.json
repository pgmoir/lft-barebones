     "Irresponsible drivers can cause congestion and delays for other motorists and road users when they park or stop on double red lines. To help drivers keep moving in London, TfL and the MPS will be stepping up enforcement, targeting particular hotspots and increasing the level of the fine.",
     "Metropolitan Police traffic wardens and traffic police community support officers (TPCSOs) will continue to undertake high visibility patrols at known bottlenecks and pinchpoints on the red route network. From now on they will issue £100 Penalty Charge Notices instead of the previous £60 Fixed Penalty Notice. However, any revenue generated will be used to increase visible transport policing across London's transport system.",
     "The MPS wardens and TPCSOs will work under a special services agreement between TfL and MPS. TfL will ensure that parking restrictions are enforceable and that wardens and TPCSOs are guided to priority locations. In the near future TfL will also be introducing CCTV enforcement to supplement the activities of police personnel.",
     "Jeroen Weimar, TfL's Director of Transport Policing and Enforcement, said: \"Just one driver blocking a red route can cause major congestion and delays for other drivers. TfL's aim is to ease congestion and further improve road safety for all road users through effective enforcement of red route regulations.",
     "\"Robust enforcement is aimed at those few selfish drivers who break the law, cause congestion for other road users and drive dangerously. This move will greatly benefit the majority of drivers who drive in accordance with the Highway Code and lead to safer and more reliable journeys.\"",
     "The MPS wardens and TPCSOs who patrol the red routes are highly trained to help manage London's traffic system. As well as enforcing important traffic and parking regulations they can direct traffic, deal with emergencies and liaise directly with the police. The wardens and TPCSOs attached to the joint TfL/MPS Transport Operational Command Unit (TOCU) over the past two years have been instrumental in keeping key routes moving as well as tackling crime and disorder on and around the transport system.",
     "TOCU Chief Superintendent Mike Humphrey said: \"Our TPCSOs and traffic wardens not only help to keep traffic flowing smoothly but also act as the eyes and ears for the police. Our aim is to make car and bus journeys in London as safe and reliable as possible, while challenging crime and disorder wherever we work.\"",
     "These new measures are expected to increase levels of compliance with parking restrictions and lead to improved traffic flow and reduced congestion, thereby improving journey times and reliability of road traffic.",
     "A marketing campaign with the message that it only takes one driver to clog up London's roads was launched by TfL at the beginning of November. The campaign includes radio, roadside ads, buses, bus-stop posters, online banners, billboards, TfL web content, leaflets and press.",
