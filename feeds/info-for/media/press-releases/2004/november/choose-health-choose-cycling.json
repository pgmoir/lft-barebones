     "Transport for London's Cycling Centre for Excellence today welcomed the Government's White Paper on Public Health, which will help further promote cycling in the capital as a means of tackling the increasing obesity levels in both children and adults. The paper supports TfL's calls for new National Standards for cycle training, and could provide an improved cycling environment so as to help further increase cyclist numbers in London."
