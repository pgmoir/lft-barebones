     "Transport for London has welcomed the publication of the London Cycle Network+ (LCN+) annual report, outlining the significant improvements made by TfL and the 33 London Boroughs in the past year.Improved processes allowed TfL and the Boroughs to make the most of their budget to upgrade the cycling infrastructure in London, investing over Â£6 million to improve not only the quantity but also the quality of cycle routes across the city. The enhanced infrastructure aims to accommodate the needs of the increasing number of cyclists, up 23% since last year."

     "In 2003/04, the cycling network grew 58km to 350km, and TfL introduced the London-wide cycle action plan (LCAP) to ensure quality targets are met. Improvements on the network include the widening of cycle lanes, e.g. on the King's Road in Hammersmith, joint bus/cycle schemes, e.g. Ealing, and town centre access improvements, e.g. Harrow, to name but a few.",
     "Rose Ades, Head of TfL's Cycling Centre of Excellence, said: \"TfL are pleased to be working closely with the London Boroughs to improve conditions for cyclists in the city. We are well on the way to improving the cycling environment as set out in the Mayor's manifesto by 2010. Our challenges for next year will include implementation of an upgrade programme along the LCN+ network as well as the continued expansion of the cycle route network.",
     "\"We are committed to making cycling an increasingly attractive transport option for those who live in, work in or visit London.\"",

     "The London Cycling Network (LCN) is managed jointly by the LCN+ team at London Borough of Camden and TfL's CCE.\u003cbr /\u003eBy introducing a strategic network of high demand routes it is envisaged that more Londoners will have a realistic option of cycling for some of their journeys. These routes will be safe, comfortable, and easy to use with enhanced access and priority for cyclists at junctions. This network of facilities is being constructed to a higher design standard and new accountability procedures are in place to ensure best practice and increased safety."
