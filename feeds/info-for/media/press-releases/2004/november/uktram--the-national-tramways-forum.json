     "A meeting of the Management Board of UKTram will take place in late November to confirm the working arrangements and structure of the new organisation. Before then, further consultation is taking place within the industry to determine any short term actions which UKTram could take to assist current and future scheme proposals.",
     "Phil Hewitt, Head of London Trams, in welcoming the adoption of the UKTram proposals stated",
     "\"The agreement to establish UKTram demonstrates the desire of both public and private sectors to join together to ensure that, in appropriate circumstances, tramways can continue to play an important role in the future of public transport in the UK.\"",

     "Commenting on the establishment of UK Tram, Brian Nimick (CPT Director-General) said:",
     "\"We welcome the establishment of UK Tram as a body bringing together all sides of the tramway industry. In the right location, tramways are a key component in supplying quality public transport and reducing dependence on cars. We look forward to working through UK Tram to help the development of tramways in our major cities.\"",
     "Tim Larner, Director of the PTEG Support Unit said:",
     "\"As Britain's largest bloc of tram and light rail promoters we look forward\u003cbr /\u003eto playing an active role in UK Tram.

It will also enable both the private and the public sector to deliver on the recommendations of the National Audit Office report on light rail. Light rail is the best solution for some of our busiest urban corridors. UK Tram will help us to ensure that we deliver those light rail schemes faster, better and cheaper.\"",
     "The LRT Forum which represents private sector participants in LRT - operators, contractors, suppliers, funders, programme managers and consultants supports the aims of UKTram.",
