     "The Report outlines the substantial progress made by TfL in improving London's environment over the last two years. In 2002 TfL developed the Environmental Action Plan with a commitment to promote sustainable and healthy means of travel; reducing the environmental impact of the transport network; improving local environments, particularly town centres and assessing the environmental impacts of new projects.",
     "Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone said:",
     "\"Like many Londoners, I can remember the dreadful 'pea-souper' smogs in the 1950s. These are now, thankfully, a thing of the past but we are still a long way from guaranteeing Londoners the clean air they have every right to expect. Transport for London is leading a wide-ranging programme to improve matters. Two of the highlights are replacing all the older buses and making London a Low Emission Zone. But it's not just cleaner air. Using 'green' electricity and installing solar panels all help to improve our environment. The land on either side of many Underground lines also help to protect London's wildlife.\"",
     "The environmental improvements achieved by TfL span all areas of London's extensive transport network including London Underground, buses and street management including:",

     "Barry Broe, TfL Director of Transport Planning and Policy, said:",
     "\"TfL has made great in-roads in increasing the viability and attractiveness of cleaner modes of transport. At the same time we have cleaned up our own vehicles. But we're not complacent, so we've set ourselves challenging targets and are moving forward with a programme of improvements to reduce pollution, energy use, waste, noise and improve recycling and London's natural and built environment.\"",
