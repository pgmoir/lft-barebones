These latest results show that we are on course to achieve our target of reducing those killed and seriously injured on our roads by 40% by 2010.\"",
     "Chris Lines, Head of the London Road Safety Unit, added; \"Every week 100 families hear the news that someone they love has been killed or hurt in a traffic collision.
