     "Produced in association with well known travel publishers Rough Guide Ltd and sponsored by Transport for London and BBC London, the guide covers a wide range of accessible venues as voted for by disabled people from around the UK, including museums, galleries, theatres, restaurants and shops.",
     "The final venues voted for were checked by a Rough Guides researcher and a panel of disabled people acting as \"mystery shoppers\", who assessed venue accessibility across a range of criteria.",
     "Speaking at one of the guide's listed venues, the Soho Theatre and Writers' Centre in London, Ken Livingstone said:",
     "\"Much work has been undertaken by Transport for London to provide accessible transport options across the capital on the tubes, buses, rail and tram ways. It is therefore good news to see that there are now so many venues and attractions that recognise the right of disabled people to visit and enjoy their facilities on the same basis as anybody else and I commend those running the venues listed in the Rough Guide for their efforts to achieve accessible environments and facilities.",
     "\"We all know there is a long way to go to achieving a fully accessible London but looking at the criteria used to assess the entries there are some very simple measures that can be taken to ensure an inclusive environment. I hope that the publication of this guide will encourage other London venues to review their own facilities and address any unnecessary barriers so that more disabled Londoners can enjoy the many wonderful attractions the city has to offer.\"",
     "Julie Fernandez, (Brenda from 'The Office') and spokesperson for the Disability Rights Commission said:",
     "'It is great to see so many places listed in the guide actively improving accessibility and putting the issue firmly on the agenda. Its publication is also a timely reminder to all of London's businesses that from 1st October they will need to make changes - such as removing physical barriers or providing the service another way - to ensure access for all. With disabled people having an annual spending power of Â£50 billion it is very much in their interests too and the DRC with it's open4all campaign is on hand to help those businesses understand and implement the new legislation.'",
     "Pip Hesketh, Head of Equality and Inclusion at TfL said:",
     "\"TfL is providing transport across London that is increasingly accessible, but disabled people will only use transport if there are accessible venues and places to visit where they can enjoy the everyday pleasures of life with family and friends.\"",
