     "Key points are as follows:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"The average Tariff 1 (weekdays 6am-8pm) fare will increase by 2.8% in line with the cost index that takes into account taxi operating costs and increases in national average earnings.\",\"Tariffs 2 and 3 (covering late evenings, nights and weekends) will also increase by an average 2.8% plus an additional 12p per journey, bringing the average increase at these times to about 4%.\",\"£1 extra charge for journeys within London that start at Heathrow Airport.\",\"No change to the minimum fare of £2.\",\"No change to the supplementary charges for Christmas and New Year.\",\"No change to the telephone booking charge of up to £2.\",\"No change to the soiling charge of up to £40.\"]}",
     "The additional 12p on Tariffs 2 and 3 is in recognition that last April's tariff revision under-compensated drivers working largely during the Tariff 2 and 3 periods for the withdrawal of separate extra charges. 28p was allowed in all tariff periods last year, but subsequent analysis showed the average actually charged during Tariffs 2 and 3 had been higher than this by up to 12p. The extra 12p together with the 28p already included in the fare for every journey undertaken at Tariff 2 and 3 will bring the total compensation in these periods to 40p, equal to the previous charge for one extra passenger.",
     "The £1 for journeys starting at Heathrow Airport may only be charged on metered journeys within Greater London. The £1 is, in effect, a contribution from customers towards the airport charges incurred by drivers for serving the Heathrow ranks and providing the information and booking desks at the Heathrow terminals. The £1 extra charge will increase the average fare for Heathrow journeys terminating within Greater London by about 3%. Some 1% of licensed taxi journeys start at Heathrow Airport and so the extra charge will increase the London-wide average taxi fare by 0.1%.",
     "Altogether, these changes will increase the average fare across the whole week by 3.4%, broadly in line with the annual increase in UK average earnings.",
     "These changes represent a balanced package, which are fair to both drivers and passengers.",
