     "TfL's revised proposals give the tram high priority over other traffic and would involve a small number of closures and require acquisition of nine properties. The proposals balance the needs of residents, road users and the tram, whilst ensuring that the business case for the tram continues to add up.",

     "\" TfL are working closely with the local community and have developed a wide range of options suggested by local groups and the boroughs for each part of the route. They will now report back to the community explaining the processes they have gone through in developing, considering and deciding between each of these options.",
     "\"Following these local briefings, the team will deposit a wide range of background information on the project in Town Halls and reference libraries along the route in April. This will include drawings outlining the 'pre-consultation design' that in my view is emerging as the frontrunner. This design would involve a small number of road closures and the acquisition of a small number of properties, numbering around 9, would be necessary. All owners and occupiers of properties which will be affected are being informed of the position and of TfL's commitment to relocate people locally and give first option to return where replacement property can be built.",
     "\"This is a flagship project for TfL and is at the heart of my strategy designed to meet the transport needs of a growing city. However, it is only with the support of the people of West London that we can make this project a success. TfL will carry out a further three month full public consultation in the summer to ensure that everyone affected by these proposals will have a genuine opportunity to have their say.\"\u003cbr /\u003e",
