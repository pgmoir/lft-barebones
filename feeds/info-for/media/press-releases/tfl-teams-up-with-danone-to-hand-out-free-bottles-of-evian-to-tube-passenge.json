     "Transport for London (TfL) has teamed up with Danone Waters UK \u0026 Ireland Ltd, for the third year in a row, to hand out free bottles of evian natural mineral water to commuters, helping to encourage customers to carry water while travelling on the Underground during the summer.",
     "Danone has provided London Underground with 250,000 bottles of evian water, which will be given out for free from tomorrow at some of London's Tube stations in support of TfL's ongoing Travel Better London campaign.",
     "The campaign aims to raise awareness of how passengers can help to reduce delays and improve journeys for everyone by making small changes to travel habits such as by carrying water while travelling, which can prevent people being taken ill on trains.",
     "The giveaway supports London Underground's ongoing efforts to cool the network and marks the third summer in a three year partnership between evian and TfL in which water is distributed across the Tube network. To date a number of measures have been introduced through a Cooling the Tube programme including; air conditioned trains on the Metropolitan, Circle, Hammersmith and City and District lines, upgraded station ventilation and portable fans installed in ticket and concourse areas.",
     "Mark Evers, Director Customer Experience, London Underground, said: `Through our partnership with Danone we want to encourage customers to carry water when they travel during the summer, which can help prevent people being taken ill on trains and reduce delays.",
     "`This partnership complements our ongoing investment in cooling the Tube, which includes improving ventilation systems at our stations and introducing new air conditioned trains, which will serve 40 per cent of the Underground network by the end of this year.'",
     "Bryan Martins, evian Marketing Director, said: `We are delighted to have the chance to help commuters keep cool this summer once again and deliver some much needed 'Live Young' refreshment.'",
     "TfL gives the following advice to customers travelling on the Tube during the summer months",
