     "Customers are advised that due to Crossrail construction work taking place at Whitechapel station, there will be a partial closure of the East London line from Saturday 30 July through to Sunday 7 August 2016.",
     "Work is taking place to build a new modern transport hub ahead of the arrival of Elizabeth line services in 2018. The addition of Elizabeth line services will be a huge boost for the area with up to 24 trains an hour in each direction, each carrying up to 1,500 passengers through the central section in peak times.",
     "This will provide passengers with a frequent service to Heathrow, Paddington, the West End and Canary Wharf, radically reducing journey times and boosting jobs and the local economy.",
     "A significant amount of work has already taken place at Whitechapel to rebuild the station, create new tunnels and build an interchange with Elizabeth line platforms. But while much of the work has been undertaken without the need to close the station, some service suspensions are required as the worksite is directly above London Overground tracks.",
     "Mike Stubbs, TfL's Director of London Overground, said:",
     "'We have worked closely with Crossrail Limited to ensure that the work impacts on as few journeys as possible and take place during a quieter period on the network, when schools are on their summer break.'",
     "London Overground services between Highbury \u0026 Islington and Shadwell will not operate from Saturday 30 July to Sunday 7 August and between Surrey Quays and New Cross from Monday 1 August to Friday 5 August.  There will also be no service between Surrey Quays and Clapham Junction on Saturday 30 and Sunday 31 July and Saturday 6 August and Sunday 7 August due to Network Rail track work. Rail replacement buses will be in operation.",
     "For more information and travel advice about the London Overground part closure customers are advised to check the TfL website \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/east-london-line-closure\"\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk/east-london-line-closure\u003c/a\u003e ",
     "A temporary station entrance was opened earlier this year to accommodate work to make Whitechapel station step-free. The station was originally opened 140 years ago and all access to Tube and London Overground services is currently via stairs. Once the work is complete in late 2018, new lifts from street level to all train platforms will make the station fully accessible for customers wanting to use the Elizabeth line, Tube or London Overground services. The ticket hall will also be refurbished and expanded with wider pathways and more ticket gates, giving customers a better, less crowded experience.",
