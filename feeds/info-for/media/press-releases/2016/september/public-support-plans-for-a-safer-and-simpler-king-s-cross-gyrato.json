     "The majority of people living, working or passing through the King's Cross area have supported early proposals for a transformation of the area.",
     "The plans, developed by Transport for London (TfL) and Islington and Camden councils, include new road layouts and better facilities for pedestrians and cyclists, which were supported by 70% of those who responded to the consultation held earlier this year.",
     "The next step for this radical improvement is to consider all responses to the consultation before developing - alongside Islington and Camden - detailed proposals for further consultation next year.",
     "The objectives of the King's Cross gyratory scheme are to:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Remove the gyratory and introduce two-way traffic, which in itself was supported by 63% of respondents, creating a simple road network and reducing journey times\",\"Improve conditions for pedestrians and cyclists with new and safer crossings and contra-flow cycle lanes\",\"Reduce traffic on some, mainly residential, streets to make it more pleasant for those living, working or passing through the area\"]}",
     "Val Shawcross, Deputy Mayor for Transport, said: \"The area around King's Cross is used by thousands of visitors, business people and local residents every day, and I'm delighted that plans for further improvements to the gyratory have such positive support from people who responded to the consultation.",
     "\"We must now look at all the consultation responses in close detail and work with the local community to ensure that everyone who uses the gyratory benefits from the changes.",
     "Given our bold plans to make cycling and walking easier across London, it's particularly important the scheme connects up with other new transport infrastructure like the extension of the North-South Cycle Superhighway.\"",
     "Residents, commuters and visitors to the King's Cross area would have easy access to cycling and walking facilities, including being better connected to the Inner Ring Road and better links to the existing and proposed cycle networks.",
     "This could help open up central London to commuters that use the mainline railway station but do not currently walk or cycle for the rest of their journey.",
     "The detailed plans will be developed to ensure they are coherently linked to other major schemes and improvements taking place across this part of London, including the extension of the North-South Cycle Superhighway between Stonecutter Street and King's Cross, and borough cycling schemes as part of the Quietway and Central London Grid programmes.",
     "Leon Daniels, Managing Director of Surface Transport at TfL, said: 'We are working with the local community and the Islington and Camden councils to provide a road network that supports the dramatic improvement of the King's Cross area. Together we will work on the detailed plans to create a modern road network, which encourages more walking and cycling and improves pedestrian crossing points.'",
     "Councillor Claudia Webbe, Islington Council's Executive Member for Environment and Transport, said: 'This is a fantastic opportunity for a game-changing overhaul of the King's Cross one-way system, which will transform the pedestrian experience and improve residents' lives.",
     "'I am pleased that the public are behind the initial proposals, which represent an historic agreement between Islington and Camden councils and TfL to change the transport priorities for the area.",
     "'I look forward to us all working together to refine these plans further still, including a detailed analysis of the public feedback that is always so valuable in ensuring the scheme brings the broadest benefits possible, for generations to come.",
     "'Traffic congestion and air pollution will be reduced under these plans, making the area more pleasant for everyone passing through, while cyclists and pedestrians in particular stand to benefit hugely as the roads of King's Cross get the modernisation they so badly need.'",
     "Councillor Phil Jones, London Borough of Camden's, Cabinet Member for Regeneration, Transport and Planning, said: 'This scheme covers an area which includes two main line stations and is of great importance for Camden and further across the capital.",
     "'Many people travel through this area daily and the number living, working and studying at King's Cross is projected to increase three fold by the time the King's Cross Central development is completed.",
     "'There is a great need to improve pedestrian and cyclist safety to support this growth and I am delighted that the 2015 consultation has confirmed that we should be prioritising walking and cycling as part of this scheme.",
     "'We look forward to continuing to work with TfL and Islington Borough Council to progress proposals and deliver significant improvements to the area for the benefit of all.'",
