     "The new entrance provides a much more welcoming and secure environment for customers accessing the station from the north side, with a new ticket machine, lighting, CCTV and real-time updates on customer information screens.",
     "The main Ilford station entrance on Cranbrook Road will also be redesigned and rebuilt by Network Rail and Crossrail Limited, with improvements over the next few years including new lifts, as part of Network Rail's Railway Upgrade Plan.",
     "The modernisation of Ilford station is part of a TfL programme of improvements being carried out along the route that will become the Elizabeth line, with customers at Manor Park, Seven Kings, Maryland, Chadwell Heath and Brentwood stations to benefit from new ticket gates and ticket machines, as well as improved customer information, lighting, external renovation and some new accessible toilets and retail spaces.",
     "All 40 stations along the route will have step-free access ahead of full Elizabeth line services in 2019, with Crossrail Limited providing lifts at the ten new central stations. TfL is installing lifts at seven surface stations - Maryland, Manor Park and Seven Kings in the east, and Taplow, Langley, Hanwell and Iver in the west. Network Rail is also carrying out further extensive work to provide or improve step-free access at all the remaining surface stations.",
     "TfL will commence work on the lifts at the eastern stations this month and step-free access from the street to all platforms will be in place at those stations by the end of next year.",
     "Howard Smith, TfL's Operations Director for TfL Rail, said:",
     "'The Elizabeth line will revolutionise travel for people from Ilford, and will also provide a huge economic boost to the area. This new entrance and ticket hall is a crucial part of the modernisation of the station, which will be supplemented by step-free access at the station for the first time. The London Borough of Redbridge has also been working hard to improve the appearance of the local area around the station.",
     "'I would like to thank customers along the route for their patience while their stations are being transformed in preparation for the Elizabeth line, which will make travel across London so much easier.'",
     "Councillor Jas Athwal, Leader of Redbridge Council said:",
     "'We're delighted that the refurbished Ilford Station York Road entrance has opened with a new ticket hall, improved facilities, new lighting and CCTV. It will significantly improve access for station users on the north side of the station.",
     "'With the arrival of the Elizabeth line, Ilford is on the cusp of huge change. Thousands of new homes, a brand new main Elizabeth line station and multi million pound improvements to transform the area around the Ilford station and Ilford High Road are all on the way. As the city moves East, Ilford's fantastic location and our ambitious regeneration plans are firmly placing it on the map.'",
     "All work has been carefully planned to minimise disruption to customers, with stations remaining open where possible. However, at Manor Park a new footbridge needs to be built to house the new lifts. While the existing footbridge is being demolished and rebuilt, customers will be asked to use a temporary footbridge which was installed during weekend closures. Customers who wish to avoid the additional stairs can use local bus routes to alternative TfL Rail stations.",
