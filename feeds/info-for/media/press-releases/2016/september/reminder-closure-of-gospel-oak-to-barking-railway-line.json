     "Replacement bus services will be available for parts of the journey and customers are advised to plan their journeys in advance. Regular pay as you go users of the Gospel Oak to Barking line will be automatically refunded the additional cost of travel via Zone 1 by Tube or rail.",
     "Network Rail is delivering the project, which is funded by the Department for Transport and Transport for London (TfL). The project will see TfL introduce new four car electric trains to replace the existing two car diesel trains from January 2018, helping to meet growing passenger demand. The trains are being built by Bombardier for TfL.",
     "Network Rail is carrying out major work including lowering four major sections of track, installing structures to carry the overhead wires and rebuilding four bridges. The first phase of the work started in June with no service between South Tottenham and Barking during weekdays and a full line closure at weekends.spanto February 2017, a full closure in both directions from Gospel Oak to Barking is necessary to carry out the second phase of the work. TfL will be providing rail replacement buses, which will operate along the route.",

     "'We would like to thank our customers for their patience while this essential work takes place. The work being carried out by Network Rail will enable us to run new longer walk-through trains on the line from January 2018, which will double capacity on the route.'",
     "Network Rail's route Managing Director, Richard Schofield, said:",
     "'This upgrade will have huge benefits to passengers and neighbours. It will enable longer, quieter and cleaner trains to run. However, to achieve this we need more space under bridges to fit electrification equipment. In some locations this requires us to lower the track. The nature of this work is noisy and I would like to thank those living near the railway for their continued patience.'",
     "Passengers should check before they travel and plan their journey in advance. From Saturday, 24 September the replacement bus services will operate as follows:",
