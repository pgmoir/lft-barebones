     "The winners will be encouraged to get into the animal spirit by dressing up as their favourite animal. A photo with Julian and special merchandise from the book will also be given as prizes.",
     "The Bolds to the Rescue is about an extraordinary family of hyenas hiding their identity and living as humans in Teddington in Middlesex.  The hyenas fear to have bitten off more than they can chew when they take in a couple of race horses who are on the run and lots of other animal waifs and strays.",
