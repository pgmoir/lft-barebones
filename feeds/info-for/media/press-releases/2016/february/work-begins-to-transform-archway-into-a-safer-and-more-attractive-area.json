Residents and road users are poised to benefit from a new public space and safer road layout that will make the area more attractive for residents and visitors, and for future investment.",
     "Today, Monday 1 February, work will start on the removal of the one-way gyratory, with two-way traffic lanes around three sides of the central island, introduction of safe cycle lanes, improved pedestrian crossings and a new public space.",
     "The improvement work is part of TfL's £4bn Road Modernisation Plan to radically transform the way the Capital's roads and public spaces are used.",

     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson MP, said: 'For far too long Archway has suffered from this badly-designed relic of a junction. By creating an attractive open space and improving the road layout, we're making it a much safer and more pleasant place to be for all.",
     "'It's great news for residents, businesses and road users, and yet another great example of the huge improvements being made across the Capital by our road modernisation programme.'",

     "Leon Daniels, Managing Director of Surface Transport at TfL, said: 'Archway residents, businesses and road users told us that they wanted this antiquated road layout brought into the 21st century when we consulted with them.",
     "'We listened, and now our work to make it safer and easier for all to travel in Archway begins. Improved cycle lanes, upgraded pedestrian crossings and a new public space will completely transform this area for everyone to enjoy.'",

     "Cllr Claudia Webbe, Islington Council's executive member for environment and transport, said: 'These works represent a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to transform Archway town centre, creating a welcoming gateway into Islington from the north.",
     "'The scheme will regenerate the area, bringing new employment and housing opportunities while transforming the environment with an attractive new public space and connecting all key modes of transport. The result will be a safer and more pleasant place for residents, visitors and cyclists.",
     "'We have been working closely with TfL to ensure we get the best possible scheme for our residents - who have shown their support for these proposals - while making sure any disruption is kept to a minimum.",
     "'Alongside TfL we will also monitor the success of the scheme long after it has been implemented, to ensure continuous improvement.'",
     "The improvement work at Archway will require road restrictions until its completion in summer 2017 so road users are advised to check before they travel.",
     "The improvement is being completed in construction phases to keep disruption to a minimum with different areas around the gyratory affected at different times.

     "TfL uses technology to better manage the network, such as Split Cycle Offset Optimisation Technique (SCOOT), which is proven to reduce delays by up to 12% and is being expanded across London.",
     "TfL also has the ability to control temporary traffic lights from its central traffic control centre, to help further ease traffic and minimise disruption. Up-to-the-minute traffic information is provided via digital road signs, TfL's traffic status page and TfL's Twitter feeds.",
