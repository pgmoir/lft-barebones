     "Transport for London (TfL) has begun a programme of improvement works at TfL Rail stations in preparation for full Crossrail services in 2019.",
     "Work is now underway at Manor Park, Seven Kings and the York Road entrance to Ilford station. A refurbishment of the ticket halls at those stations is expected to be completed by the middle of the year.",
     "The stations will remain open and operational for customers while work takes place, although at Ilford the York Road entrance will need to be closed from Monday 22 February until mid 2016, customers can continue to use the main entrance on Cranbrook Road.",
     "Work will be carried out behind hoardings or during engineering hours to minimise any impact on customers.  Network Rail and Crossrail Limited will also continue to carry out work along the line ahead of Crossrail services opening.",
     "The stations will all benefit from:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"External deep cleaning, refurbishment and repair of  the station building;\",\"Improved signage and lighting;\",\"Internal layout redesign to make it easier for customers to use the station;\",\"Station refurbishment including re-decoration and new flooring;\",\"New ticket machines;\",\"Additional ticket gates at Seven Kings;\",\"New ticket gates and accessible customer toilet at Manor Park;\",\"Ilford station will have a new ticket hall at York Road.\"]}",
     "Howard Smith, TfL's Operations Director of Crossrail, said:",
     "'This is the start of the TfL station improvements programme that will transform stations along the Crossrail route.  We hope that people will really take pride in these refreshed stations.  Once the improvements are complete, customers using Manor Park and Seven Kings stations will enjoy modernised, cleaner and brighter stations, with improved facilities. Customers using the Ilford York Road entrance will also notice the changes. Although customers will largely be unaffected by these works and train services will not be impacted, we ask customers to bear with us while the stations are transformed and apologise for any disruption.'",
     "Further TfL Rail station works will also commence later in 2016 to bring step free access to Manor Park, Seven Kings and Maryland.",
     "TfL-run Crossrail will mean more frequent journeys from Manor Park, Seven Kings and Ilford to central London with 12 trains per hour at peak times. Travelling from Seven Kings to Tottenham Court Road will take around 24 minutes and just 19 minutes to Canary Wharf."
