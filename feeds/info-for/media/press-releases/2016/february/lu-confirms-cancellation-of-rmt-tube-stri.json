     "London Underground (LU) has confirmed this weekend's Tube strike planned by the RMT union has been called off.",
     "Steve Griffiths, London Underground's Chief Operating Officer, said:",
     "`I welcome the RMT's decision to call off the strike action and end this dispute.  Our station modernisation programme now continues, with our changes meaning a more personal service for customers, and record numbers of staff in public areas visible and available to help customers where they need it most.",
     "`As we've always promised, we're delivering these improvements with no compulsory redundancies, no-one being asked to work more hours or lose any pay, as well as continued focus on work-life balance within rosters. In addition, around 900 staff are either being promoted or securing permanent roles with London Underground, having previously been employed on fixed term contracts.'",
     "LU's modernisation of station staffing has seen staff redeployed from underused ticket offices and back rooms to where they can help customers most effectively - at gate lines, in ticket halls and on platforms. All stations remain staffed and controlled at all times, with staff now equipped with digital devices to enable them to give them the most up-to-date travel and ticketing advice to customers. At stations where staff have been redeployed customer satisfaction has risen.",
     "The changes to rosters are fairer for all staff and will share out the 'reserve shifts', where staff are deployed to the stations where they're needed most, among everyone. LU has promised that if it has to change someone's shift at fewer than 48 hours' notice, it will not happen again for at least six months, asking for some flexibility at most twice a year."
