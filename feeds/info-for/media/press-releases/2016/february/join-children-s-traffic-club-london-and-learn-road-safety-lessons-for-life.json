     "This spring, Transport for London (TfL) is inviting all pre-school children in London to join a special club to teach them road safety lessons that will stay with them, and help them, for life.",
     "TfL's Children's Traffic Club London is a free road safety education programme designed to give pre-school children aged three and four, and their parents and carers, valuable road safety skills. It also promotes sustainable modes of transport such as walking, scooting and cycling.",
     "Every child who joins the Club will receive a welcome pack containing fun characters, stickers, stories and songs. Each pack has a 'Magic Code', which unlocks interactive games, stories and songs on an engaging website where children can track their journey using a fun route map.",
     "The Children's Traffic Club London comes complete with a free app containing fun road safety and transport games to further help young Londoners to stay safe.",
     "Leon Daniels, Managing Director of Surface Transport at TfL, said: `Children's Traffic Club London is a brilliant, fun and engaging way to educate pre-school children about the importance of staying safe on London's roads. That's why we are funding this initiative for all London's pre-school children, as we know how important early intervention is when helping young people to stay safe. It is great to have such strong support from our partners across the London boroughs and we look forward to continuing to work together to encourage all pre-school children in London to register with the Club.'",
     "TfL is committed to reducing the number of people killed and seriously injured on London's roads. Twice a year, in line with the dates that children start pre-school, an invitation is sent to all London nurseries to register all three and four year old children into the Club. Members' packs are then sent to the nurseries who distribute them to their children to take home.",
     "Since September 2015, 66,542 children from 33 London boroughs have registered for the Club. TfL aims to increase this number to 100,000 by the end of this school year.",
     "TfL's most recent research shows that, as a result of registering with the Club, 87% of parents or carers reported that their child is more aware of the importance of road safety.",
