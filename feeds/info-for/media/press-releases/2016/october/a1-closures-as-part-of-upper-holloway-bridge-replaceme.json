     "Transport for London (TfL) is advising road users that a series of closures of a section of the A1 are required later this month to continue work on replacing the century-old Upper Holloway Bridge. This vital work means users of the A1 Holloway Road will need to use alternative routes and leave more time for journeys to reduce disruption during the closures, which will start from 22:00 on Friday 21 October.",
     "The closures, between Fairbridge Road and Wedmore Gardens, are to allow for vital utility services to be moved from the Upper Holloway Bridge to a specially-made utilities bridge. The road bridge needs to be replaced and the utilities bridge has been built to ensure Londoners do not experience an interruption to their services when it is rebuilt and that future utility work will not result in road closures or disruption.",
     "The new utilities bridge was built in June but the cables and pipes could not be moved across at that time due their complex layout, very poor condition and a leaking water main. Now these issues have been safely resolved, the transfer of utilities can be carried out.",
     "Nick Fairholme, Director of Projects and Programmes in Surface Transport at TfL, said:",
     "'The vital work to replace the Upper Holloway Bridge with a strong, future-proofed and durable structure now requires complex rerouting of the utilities. To safely complete this complicated work we need a series of closures of the A1 and we are sorry for the disruption this will cause to road journeys in the area.",
     "'We are doing everything we can to minimise disruption and complete the works as quickly as possible. We are committed to helping drivers, local businesses and local residents plan their journeys to help avoid the worst of the disruption and apologise for delays caused during this vital work.'",
     "Once completed, the new Upper Holloway road bridge will not only be stronger - to last more than another century - it will also have better surfaces and ultimately upgraded streetlights.",
     "In order to transfer the utilities before the road bridge's demolition and reconstruction at Christmas, a number of closures will be required from Friday 21 October. Signed diversions will be in place and bus routes 17, 43, 263, 271 and N41 will be diverted. Pedestrian access will be maintained at all times.",
     "The closures of the A1 between Fairbridge Road and Wedmore Gardens will be:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Friday 21 October 22:00 - Monday 31 October 05:00 - closed to all vehicles in both directions\",\"Monday 31 October 05:00 - Saturday 24 December 22:00- closed to all vehicles travelling southbound\",\"Friday 18 November 22:00 - Monday 21 November 05:00 - closed to all vehicles in both directions\",\"Friday 25 November 22:00 - Monday 28 November 05:00 - closed to all vehicles in both directions\"]}",
     "This will be followed by the pre-planned full closure between 24 December 2016 and 16 January 2017, when the bridge will be demolished and replaced. The installation of a new bridge will allow the electrification of the Gospel Oak to Barking London Overground line, enabling passenger trains to run again from February 2017.",
     "To mitigate disruption, TfL will look to re-plan the work at nearby Archway and Highbury Corner and is working with the surrounding boroughs to ban all non-emergency roadworks on nearby roads. TfL has also put in place plans to swiftly remove any vehicles blocking key surrounding routes to help reduce disruption.",
     "To ensure residents, businesses and road users are aware of these closures a comprehensive communications plan - including letters and emails - has been created. Signage will be in place at bus stops and London Underground stations in the area. Variable messaging signs will be in place on the A1 advising drivers of the closure, and TfL will be providing up-to-date information through the @tfltrafficnews Twitter feed and helping those who normally use the bridge plan their journey with the webpage - \u003ca href=\"http://tfl.gov.uk/upper-holloway-bridge\"\u003etfl.gov.uk/upper-holloway-bridge\u003c/a\u003e ",
