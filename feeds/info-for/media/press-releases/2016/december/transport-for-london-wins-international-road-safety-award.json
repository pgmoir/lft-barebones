     "Transport for London (TfL) has been recognised internationally for its work to improve the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and motorcyclists in London.",
     "At a ceremony on Tuesday (13 December), Prince Michael of Kent awarded TfL the International Road Safety Award for its ground-breaking work and promising results for reducing death and serious injury.",
     "Analysis of police collision and travel demand data led TfL to put in place a range of initiatives which contributed to a three per cent drop in the number of people killed and seriously injured on London's streets (2,092) in 2015, its lowest ever level.",
     "Projects included the launch of the Safer Lorry Scheme, the installation of special sensors at pedestrian crossings which adjust crossing times when large groups of people are detected as well as the trialling of 20mph limits and average speed cameras on key routes.",
     "TfL is now looking to go further and is working to deliver London Mayor Sadiq Khan's plans to remove the most dangerous Heavy Goods Vehicles from the Capital's roads by 2020 through the Direct Vision Standard. This is the first scheme of its kind in the world, directly addressing the issue of lethal driver blind-spots.",
     "Other measures include expanding the use of 20mph limits, introducing motorcycle and pedal cycle skills courses as well as developing a world leading bus safety standard which includes the latest safety technologies to help avoid and reduce the impact of collisions involving buses.",
     "Leon Daniels, TfL's Managing Director of Surface Transport, said: `We are delighted to receive this award which recognises the hard work our teams have put in to reduce casualties on London's roads, however any death or serious injury is a tragedy, and our priority is to eradicate such incidents. Last year saw the lowest level since records began, but there is much more to be done.",
     "`We are working to reduce collisions involving all road users by creating more attractive, accessible and people-friendly streets, making walking and cycling safer, working with London boroughs to introduce more 20mph limits, looking to remove the most dangerous Heavy Goods Vehicles from the Capital's roads by 2020 and continuing our road safety education and enforcement programmes.'",
     "Adrian Walsh, Director of the Prince's awards scheme, said: `The judges thought that it was a first class programme of action, well planned, adequately funded, and well organised with promising results.'",
