     "The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has announced £220m funding for boroughs to deliver transport, town centre and public space improvements to improve the lives of Londoners.",
     "The funding will be used by boroughs across the Capital for a wide range of projects to reduce dangers on the roads, transform local areas, encourage cycling and walking and improve air quality.",
     "Transport for London (TfL) will invest £148m in Local Implementation Plans that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy, as well as a further £70m for other schemes, including funding for strategic walking and cycling programmes such as Quietways, Mini-Hollands and Liveable Neighbourhoods.  This will be key to delivering the Mayor's Healthy Streets vision of a city that is more pleasant to live and move around in.",
     "Each of London's 33 boroughs benefits from the funding, with more than £1bn to be invested across TfL's Business Plan to 2021/22, in which the Mayor announced record levels of investment to make cycling easier and safer, including support for borough cycling schemes, and improve the capital's air quality.",

     "The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: `I'm proud that through the new TfL Business Plan we are creating a modern and affordable transport network for the capital, and am delighted that we are able to invest an increased level of funding across the boroughs next year too. By making walking and cycling easier and safer, and funding projects that will improve air quality, we can help boroughs right across the capital to deliver transport and public space improvements that are going to make a real difference to the lives of Londoners.'",
     "Councillor Julian Bell, Chair of London Councils Transport \u0026 Environment Committee, said: `London's boroughs welcome this long term settlement by the Mayor of London, which will assist in making borough streets greener and safer. It provides a much needed firm base from which to work with the Mayor and TfL to deliver the improvements to London's local transport scene as part of a city for all Londoners.'",
     "The Mayor and TfL will also work closely with boroughs in the New Year on a stronger offer of support to deliver the projects, and a review of where they are targeted to ensure they are delivered where they are most needed.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Mike Brown, said: `We will work closer than ever before with all London boroughs to ensure London remains a world-class city with more attractive, accessible and people-friendly streets. Through this funding, Londoners will see real improvements to their local areas, through safer streets, improved public areas, more reliable public transport and increased walking and cycling facilities.'",

     "Notes to Editors",
