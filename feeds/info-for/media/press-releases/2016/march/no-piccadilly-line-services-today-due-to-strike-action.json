     "Transport for London (TfL) has reminded Tube customers of travel advice available to help them get around during today's 24-hour Piccadilly line strike.",
     "Drivers on the Piccadilly line who are trade union members are striking until the end of today.",
     "There will be no Piccadilly line service during the strike.  For customers travelling between Heathrow airport and central London, Heathrow Connect and Heathrow Express services are available to and from London Paddington station. Separate fares apply for these services. Please check on the Heathrow Express and Heathrow Connect websites.",
     "Interchange stations along the Piccadilly line - Finsbury Park, Green Park and King's Cross St. Pancras stations in particular - will be much busier than usual. Services on other Tube and Rail lines, the bus network and river will run as normal but are expected to be busy as passengers seek alternative routes. Roads in west and central London are also expected to be busy.",
     "Extra buses will be provided to help Londoners get around. Buses do not accept cash, so customers will need to use their contactless debit or credit card, Oyster or bus \u0026 tram pass to continue their journeys. Customers are advised to allow more time for their journeys.",
     "The Piccadilly line is expected to run a Saturday service tomorrow Friday 25 March as part of the Easter Bank Holiday arrangements, although customers are advised to check before they travel.",
     "Pat Hansberry, Operations Director for London Underground, said:",
     "'There will be no service on the Piccadilly line today due to 24-hour strike action, though other Tube lines will continue to run as normal. Our customers are advised to check our real-time travel information to help them get around.",
     "'This indefensible strike has been called to back drivers who refused to drive Piccadilly line trains on their shifts - without good reason - resulting in delays to our customers.'",
     "TfL advises all customers to allow more time for their journeys and to check before they travel at tfl.gov.uk/tube-strike and by following @TfLTravelAlerts, @TfLTrafficNews and @TfLBusAlerts on Twitter.",
     "Easter engineering works on the Tube, TfL Rail and London Overground will go ahead as planned from tomorrow, Friday 25 March. Details of the works are available from tfl.gov.uk/easter."
