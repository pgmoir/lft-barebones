     "TfL has reminded Tube customers of travel advice available to help them get around, should planned strike action on the Piccadilly line take place from tonight.",
     "Drivers on the Piccadilly line who are trade union members are planning to strike from 21:00 for 24 hours.",
     "If the strike goes ahead, there will be no Piccadilly line service from late tonight and all day tomorrow.",
     "For customers travelling between Heathrow airport and central London, Heathrow Connect and Heathrow Express services will be available to and from London Paddington station.",
     "Although the strike begins at 21:00, London Underground (LU) will be able to keep Piccadilly line services running until around 22:30. Customers are therefore advised to complete journeys on the Piccadilly line by 22:30 and to travel earlier if possible.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Much busier\"}",
     "Interchange stations along the Piccadilly line - Finsbury Park, Green Park and King's Cross St. Pancras stations in particular - will be much busier than usual.",
     "Services on other Tube and Rail lines, the bus network and river will run as normal but are expected to be busy as passengers seek alternative routes.",
     "Roads in west and central London are also expected to be busy.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Help Londoners get around\"}",
     "Extra buses will be provided to help Londoners get around. Buses do not accept cash, so customers will need to use their contactless debit or credit card, Oyster or bus \u0026 tram pass to continue their journeys.",
     "Customers are advised to allow more time for their journeys.",
     "The Piccadilly line is expected to run a Saturday service on Friday 25 March as part of the Easter Bank Holiday arrangements, although customers are advised to check before they travel.",
     "Pat Hansberry, Operations Director for LU, said: 'Our customers are advised to check our real-time travel tools, should the planned strike go ahead on the Piccadilly line from late tonight.",
     "'This indefensible strike has been called to back drivers who refused to drive Piccadilly line trains on their shifts - without good reason - resulting in delays to our customers.",
     "'That said, we remain available for talks and are keen for the union leaderships to engage with us, so that Londoners aren't subjected to unnecessary disruption.'",
