     "Tube customers could see Camden Town Tube station completely transformed over the coming years to improve access and capacity after proposals from TfL received strong support from residents, customers and local businesses.",
     "Results from a public consultation published today show that 95% of respondents agree with the plans to upgrade Camden Town Tube station.",
     "A second consultation will take place later in 2016 on plans for the building above the proposed second entrance of the station.  A third consultation in 2017 will also take place on the design of the new station.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Bigger and better\"}",
     "Gareth Powell, London Underground's Director for Strategy, said: 'We're very pleased with the feedback from our customers about the proposed upgrade.",
     "'We'll now continue working with Camden Council and local people to develop our plans to deliver a bigger and better station in Camden.'",
     "Camden Town station is one of the busiest interchange stations on the Underground network - over 80,000 people use the station everyday - and this is set to increase over the coming years as London's success continues to drive rapid population growth.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Wide range of improvements\"}",
     "To meet this demand, and make journeys through the station easier for customers, a wide range of improvements are proposed. These benefits could include:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"A new second entrance and exit to the station\",\"Three new escalators\",\"Step-free access from the street to trains, with two new lifts\",\"More space to change between trains\",\"The station remaining open during busy periods and removing the need for frequent crowd control measures\"]}",
     "The modernisation and extension of the station would support the vibrant local economy and community, and reduce walking time between the station and the popular Camden Lock area.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Unique character\"}",
     "The existing station entrance would remain in use, and no changes would be made to nearby buildings, helping to sustain Camden's unique character.",
     "London Underground is working closely with Camden Council on all proposals and, subject to funding and the relevant permissions, work on the station project could begin in 2019, for completion in 2023/4.",
     "The full report of the public consultation is available on the TfL website at \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/camden-town-upgrade\"\u003etfl.gov.uk/camden-town-upgrade\u003c/a\u003e "
