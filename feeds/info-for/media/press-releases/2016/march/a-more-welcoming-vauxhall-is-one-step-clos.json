     "The replacement of the Vauxhall gyratory system with a safer and more welcoming road environment has moved a step closer today as Transport for London (TfL) announced that its proposals have been supported by the public during a recent consultation.",
     "More than half of all respondents supported the plans that will see the one-way traffic system returned to two-way, making it less of an intimidating, motor-dominated area, with opportunities for a range of new pedestrian and cyclist facilities. New and upgraded cycle lanes would be segregated and signalised cycle crossings would be installed. The work would improve cycle links to and through the area, connecting to Cycle Superhighway 5.",
     "Removing intimidating, dangerous and unwelcoming gyratories can also stimulate urban areas, helping to support new jobs, houses and growth. The Vauxhall improvements are being part-funded by Lambeth Council and through TfL's £360m growth fund - designed to create jobs and homes by unlocking development across London.",
     "TfL will now review and consider all points raised in the consultation and will publish a second report this autumn, in which responses to commonly raised issues will be set out and the next steps for the project will be confirmed.",
     "Leon Daniels, Managing Director of Surface Transport at TfL, said: `Our consultation on making Vauxhall gyratory safer, more accessible and better connected received more than 1,200 responses, with well over half supporting our proposals. We are now reviewing each response in detail and will publish a comprehensive report later this year on the next steps for this transformational project. We are committed to making Vauxhall a more pleasant environment, to support local investment and a growing population.'",
     "Cllr Jack Hopkins, Lambeth's Cabinet member for Jobs \u0026 Growth, said: `We welcome the report and public support for the proposals which we believe will allow Vauxhall to realise its true potential as a vibrant riverside town.'",
     "The improvements in Vauxhall form part of TfL's Road Modernisation Plan, the £4bn investment in London's roads. This programme will ensure that the Capital's roads are able to support the needs of a growing population of Londoners and commuters.",
