     "The scheme has grown from 6,000 bikes to 11,500 bikes and there are now more than 785 docking stations with 21,083 docking points across London - covering from Camden Town in the north to Battersea in the south and from Stratford in the east to Shepherd's Bush in the west.",
     "The sixth anniversary comes as Santander Cycles celebrates both a record-breaking weekend and month for hires. The weekend of July 30 and 31, when Prudential RideLondon was held, saw an unprecedented 92,527 hires, beating the previous record from May this year of 89,833.",
     "July saw a record 1,188,428 bikes hired, beating the previously highest month of July 2014 when 1,183,182 bikes were hired.",

     "'I hope that this free weekend of cycling gets even more people enjoying cycling, encouraging Londoners to make it part of their everyday lives.'",
     "Paul Cowperthwaite, TfL's General Manager of Santander Cycles, said: 'For six years, London's cycle hire scheme has been making life easier for Londoners and visitors wanting to get around the city.",
     "'It has also encouraged many people to take up cycling for the first time. To mark this, we're pleased to be able to offer a free weekend and encourage new users to try out the scheme.",
     "'Santander Cycles is one of the easiest ways to make short journeys around London and its popularity continues to grow with a record 92,000 hires on the last weekend of July.",
     "'We are committed to growing the scheme further and making it even easier for Londoners and visitors to jump on a bike and explore London.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Very special\"}",
     "Keith Moor, Chief Marketing Officer, Santander UK, said: 'There really is something very special about exploring London on a Santander Cycle and for this weekend, it's also free!",
     "'It's another example of the excitement we have brought to the scheme and gives people the opportunity to see and experience London in a different light.'",
     "The official Santander Cycles app, which was updated last month to improve customer experience, has also made the scheme more accessible. It has been downloaded 235,000 times and currently 8% of all Santander Cycles hires are made through the app.",
