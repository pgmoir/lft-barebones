     "Transport for London (TfL) is today advising customers who use Custom House DLR station that work to redevelop the station will start in January 2017.",
     "The work will include taking down the existing station canopies and the installation of a new mezzanine deck above the DLR platforms, as well as two additional staircases. It is due to be completed in November 2017 and will increase capacity at the station by 50 per cent ahead of Elizabeth line services serving the station in December 2018. Given the scale of the work, which will include the installation of around 400 tonnes of steel and the use of 300,000 litres of concrete, the station will need to be closed while the work takes place.",
     "Transport for London's DLR Director, Claire Mann, said: `Work will be taking place next year to increase capacity at Custom House station ahead of Elizabeth line services commencing in 2018. We apologise to customers for the disruption this may cause but it is vital work and due its nature it will not be possible to keep the station open while construction work takes place. When the work is complete, the station will be much more spacious - making journeys for customers easier and preparing the station for increased passenger numbers.'",
     "Stretching from Reading and Heathrow in the west across to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east, the Elizabeth line will change the way people travel around London and the South East and add much needed new capacity to London's transport infrastructure. A fleet of brand new 200 metre long trains will run on the Elizabeth line, featuring nine walk-through carriages, air conditioning, CCTV and real-time travel information.",
     "While the station will be closed trains will continue to run and customers are advised to use either Royal Victoria or Prince Regent stations which are both short walks away from Custom House station and ExCeL London.\u003cbr /\u003e",
     "Notes for Editors:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"The work will be carried out by Dye \\u0026 Butler.\",\"The DLR network was the first fully accessible railway in the UK and provides step-free entrance and exits to all stations and trains.\",\"The number of people using the DLR has increased rapidly, rising from 10 million in the early 1990s to more nearly 117 million in 2015/16.\",\"It was announced earlier this year that Crossrail will be known as the Elizabeth line from December 2018 when services start running through central London.\",\"The Elizabeth line will serve 40 stations and run more than 100km from Reading and Heathrow in the west, through new twin-bore 21km (13 miles) tunnels below central London to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east.\",\"When the Elizabeth line opens it will increase central London's rail-based transport network capacity by 10 per cent, supporting regeneration and cutting journey times across the city. Services are due to commence through central London in 2018 and an estimated 200 million passengers will use the Elizabeth line annually.\"]}"
