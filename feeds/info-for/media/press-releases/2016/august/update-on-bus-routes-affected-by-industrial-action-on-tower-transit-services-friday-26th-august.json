     "As 0700 hours today, TfL is advising that strike action by members of the Unite union, who work for Tower Transit, is causing moderate/extensive disruption to bus services in east and central London.",
     "Overall, almost 32% of normal bus services are operating across the affected routes. Of the 20 affected day bus routes, a reduced service is operating on 17 routes - 23, 25, 28, 30, 58, 69, 70, 212, 236, 266, 308, 339, 425, 444,488, W14 and W15.",
     "Some routes will run a shortened service, such as the 25 which will run from Aldgate to Stratford rather than from Ilford to Oxford Circus, due to the action and reduced operating capacity.",
     "The strike action began at 00.01 this morning and will continue until 23.59 tonight - affecting night time bus services well into the early hours on Saturday (27th August) morning.",
     "Day bus services on Saturday and Sunday will operate as normal, but another strike is currently scheduled for Monday affecting the same routes.",
     "The strike is over a dispute between Unite and Tower Transit over bus driver employment conditions. TfL is calling for Unite and Tower Transit to swiftly resolve the dispute so that passengers are not disrupted.",
     "Tower Transit operates less than 5% of London's bus services from the three garages affected. Services operated by other companies across the Capital are unaffected and will operate a normal service.",
     "We would encourage bus passengers in east and central London to check before they travel at \u003ca href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/\"\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e . Passengers will also be kept informed of the status of their services in a range of ways, including:",
