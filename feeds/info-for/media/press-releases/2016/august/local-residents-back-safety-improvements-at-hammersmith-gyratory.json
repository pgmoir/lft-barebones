     "TfL has released the results of the Hammersmith gyratory improvement consultation, which received a high level of public support.",
     "Nearly 80% of respondents backed TfL's plans for improvements, which will significantly improve cyclist safety at one of London's most intimidating and busy junctions.",
     "Dedicated cycling crossings will be installed, pedestrian facilities will be improved and a new bus lane added that will boost the reliability of bus services for customers.",
     "The direct, kerb-segregated two-way route for cyclists will remove the need to cycle around the gyratory, mixing with fast-moving traffic, and will break a key barrier to cycling in west London.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Minimise disruption\"}",
     "TfL intends to proceed with the changes, but will investigate retaining a pedestrian crossing between the south side of Hammersmith Broadway and Shepherd's Bush Road following consultation feedback. Construction is set to start next summer and is expected to be completed in summer 2018.",
     "The Mayor has asked TfL to ensure any plans for construction take on board all lessons learned from previous routes - to minimise disruption to motorists and all road users when the changes are made.",
     "This includes appropriate phasing and coordination - including with maintenance work on Hammersmith Bridge - and the potential for more night time working to complete roadworks faster.",
     "The transformation of Hammersmith gyratory will include:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"A 750 metre segregated two-way cycle track on the north side of Hammersmith gyratory\",\"New eastbound cycle track along King Street, to enable onward connections on the A315 corridor\",\"Eight cyclist-specific signals at junctions to separate cyclists and motorised vehicles\",\"Pedestrian countdown signals at the crossings of King Street, Beadon Road, Shepherd's Bush Road, Queen Caroline Street, Hammersmith Road and Butterwick\",\"Widened sections of footway on King Street to provide more space for pedestrians\",\"A new bus lane on Beadon Road between Glenthorne Road and Hammersmith Broadway to improve bus reliability\"]}",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Important junction\"}",
     "Val Shawcross, Deputy Mayor for Transport, said: 'These improvements to the Hammersmith gyratory will benefit cyclists, bus users, drivers and pedestrians. It's an important and busy junction that needs to be made safer for the thousands of people who use it every day.",
     "'For cyclists in particular, the changes will mean not having to cycle directly round the gyratory alongside other traffic, making a big difference to their safety.",
     "'The changes to the gyratory have to work for everyone and we've asked TfL to continue to work with local residents and look closely at the lessons from previous schemes to minimise disruption when the changes are made.",
     "'This includes the feedback they've received about retaining a pedestrian crossing between the south side of Hammersmith Broadway and Shepherd's Bush Road.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Listened carefully\"}",
     "Leon Daniels, Managing Director of Surface Transport at TfL, said: 'We have listened carefully to local residents and businesses and will deliver a whole range of improvements to redesign the intimidating gyratory and encourage more walking and cycling through Hammersmith.",
     "'We will also work hard to find a way of keeping a signalised pedestrian crossing across Hammersmith Broadway.",
     "'The gyratory is currently a serious barrier to cyclists and removing this block from riding through Hammersmith and improving pedestrian facilities will help transform the area.'",
     "Cllr Wesley Harcourt, Hammersmith \u0026 Fulham's Council Cabinet Member for Environment, Transport and Residents' Services, said: 'It is great that so many people have shown their support for plans to make cycling safer and less intimidating in Hammersmith \u0026 Fulham.",
     "The Hammersmith gyratory can be a daunting prospect for cyclists, with many lanes and exits. These plans will ensure not only cyclists, but pedestrians and other road users can all navigate the junction safely and easily.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Beneficial impact\"}",
     "Patricia Bench, Director of HammersmithLondon BID, said: 'As a cyclist, navigating the Hammersmith gyratory can be a daunting prospect so we are very happy that Transport for London has listened to local residents and businesses, the people who use this junction on a daily basis, to form their proposals.",
     "'The BID is a strong advocate of green transport so a safer and more accessible gyratory will encourage more people to cycle to work and will have a beneficial impact on the area, together with new bicycle infrastructure to help cater for the increasing numbers of commuter cyclists.",
     "'HammersmithLondon will continue to work closely with TfL to keep businesses informed as construction gets underway and help keep disruption to a minimum.'",
     "TfL is working with the London Borough of Hammersmith \u0026 Fulham to develop proposals for cycle improvements along the A315 corridor, which runs through Hammersmith gyratory.",
     "These improvements would provide a continuous cycle route across the whole of the borough and are due for consultation next year. This route would form part of Cycle Superhighway 9 which is still in the early stages of design.",
     "It is subject to further work and discussion with stakeholders including the London Boroughs of Hammersmith \u0026 Fulham and Hounslow.",
     "The changes to the Hammersmith gyratory will be future-proofed to take into account this potential new cycle route and would allow for any long term further transformation of the gyratory.",
