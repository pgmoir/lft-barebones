     "Transport for London (TfL) has today issued advice to bus passengers ahead of planned strike action by members of the Unite union who work for bus operator Tower Transit, which could affect a number of bus services on Friday 26 August and Monday 29 August.",
     "The planned strike action is the result of a dispute between Unite and Tower Transit over bus driver employment conditions.  It would see two 24-hour strikes on Friday 26 August and Monday 29 August and would likely result in severe disruption on a number of bus routes in east and west London, including some routes which run into central London, with some services not running.",
     "Tower Transit operates less than five per cent of the bus services in London and services operated by other companies across the Capital are unaffected and will operate a normal service.",
     "TfL is encouraging Unite and Tower Transit to resolve the dispute in a way that avoids disruption to passengers.",
     "Mike Weston, TfL's Director of Buses, said: `I'm sorry that some of our customers may face disruption to their usual routes.  I would advise everyone to check our website for the latest updates and we'll be working hard to ensure that customers have up to the minute information about which services are affected.  We're also encouraging Tower Transit and Unite to resolve the dispute as quickly as possible to avoid disruption to passengers' journeys.'",

Motorists are advised to avoid driving in the Notting Hill area and west London across the Bank Holiday weekend, as a number of road closures will be in place from Saturday 28 August to early morning on Tuesday 30 August.  The easiest ways to travel to and from the Carnival will be by Tube, bus, cycling or walking.  However, some stations close to the Carnival will be closed or will be exit only, and some bus routes will be diverted or stop short of their final destination."
