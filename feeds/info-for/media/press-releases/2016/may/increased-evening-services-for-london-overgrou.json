     "London Overground customers are now benefiting from an increase in evening services after extra trains were added to a number of routes on the network.",
     "Demand has continued to grow on the London Overground, particularly at night, and to meet this services on the East London line have been increased from two to four trains per hour between 22:00 and 23:30, on the following routes:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Dalston Junction to New Cross\",\"Highbury \\u0026 Islington to West Croydon\",\"Highbury \\u0026 Islington to Crystal Palace\",\"Dalston Junction to Clapham Junction\"]}",
     "The changes, introduced this week, follow improvements completed at the end of 2015 where much of the London Overground network went from four to five carriage trains, increasing capacity by 25 per cent.",
     "Mike Stubbs, Director of London Overground, said: `This is great news for our customers. The East London line is becoming increasingly popular, particularly at night, with many enjoying what London has to offer. To meet this increase in demand we have boosted frequency by 50 per cent on some late night services, significantly increasing capacity.'",
     "Earlier this year TfL announced that Arriva will take over from existing operator LOROL in November 2016 to operate the London Overground network, and will support TfL in delivering further improvements for customers on the already hugely popular network. These will include modernised stations and more frequent services, the first of which is planned on the North London line. New trains will also be introduced in 2018, transforming journeys on London Overground routes out of Liverpool Street and on the Gospel Oak to Barking line.",

     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"London Overground now carries over 184 million customers a year, equating to more than 585,000 a day.\",\"Capacity on other London Overground services has been increased by a further 25 per cent through the introduction of a fifth car to trains across the network which was completed at the end of 2015.\",\"A fleet of 45 new trains will be introduced from 2018 on the Liverpool Street to Enfield Town, Cheshunt (via Seven Sisters) and Chingford routes, as well as on the routes between Barking and Gospel Oak and between Romford and Upminster. The new trains, to be built by Bombardier, will transform the service experienced by customers on these routes and support hundreds of UK jobs and more than 20 apprenticeships.\"]}"
