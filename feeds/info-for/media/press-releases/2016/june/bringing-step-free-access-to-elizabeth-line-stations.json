     "Transport for London (TfL) has awarded a contract to deliver step-free access at three stations as part of major station improvements ahead of Elizabeth line services commencing in December 2018.",
     "Maryland, Manor Park and Seven Kings stations will become fully accessible. It was confirmed in 2014 that all 40 stations on the Elizabeth line route will have step-free access.",
     "The station improvements will include new lifts, walkways and footbridges to Seven Kings and Manor Park stations. Maryland ticket hall will also be remodelled as part of the improvements to the stations currently served by TfL Rail, which will become part of the Elizabeth line in 2018. Customers at these stations are already benefiting from having staff present from first to last train.",
     "The upgrade of these stations is part of TfL's work on the eastern section of the new Elizabeth line route between Liverpool Street and Shenfield. This work will ensure that the network is accessible for all when it is fully operational, linking east London and Essex with the West End, west London and Berkshire.",
     "The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said:",
     "'I'm determined to make London a fairer city, open and accessible to all, and one where we improve the support for those less able to get around London. My team are working on a more ambitious approach to improving step-free access in our stations, and I am very pleased that passengers using Maryland, Manor Park or Seven Kings are going to benefit from major improvements to their stations ahead of the launch of the new Elizabeth line services.'",
     "Emily Ball, TfL's Accessibility and Station Upgrade Manager, said:",
     "'These works mark the next stage of the ongoing TfL station improvements programme that will transform stations on the Elizabeth line route. Once these works are complete, customers using Maryland, Manor Park and Seven Kings will enjoy step-free access and new station facilities.'",
     "HOCHTIEF will deliver the station improvements, with work on site starting later this summer. Step-free access is expected to be available at the stations from late 2017. Major Network Rail work to upgrade stations and track is also ongoing at stations along the TfL Rail route to prepare the existing railway for the Elizabeth line.",
     "Notes to Editors:",
