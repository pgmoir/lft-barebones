     "Transport for London is set to carry out essential track replacement work at Camden Town Tube station starting on 30 July. The modernisation work will improve journey times and ensure a more reliable service in the coming years, as the Tube carries ever more passengers.",
     "The nature of the work means that there will need to be changes to northbound Northern line services over five working days. Between Monday 1 and Friday 5 August, northbound Northern line trains will run as follows:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Charing Cross branch trains will only go to High Barnet / Mill Hill East\",\"Bank branch trains will only go to Edgware\"]}",
     "While the work takes place, Tube customers are advised to start their journeys on the correct branch of the Northern line, and avoid changing at Camden Town or Euston during the evening peak as the stations will be extremely busy, particularly between 17:30 - 18:30.",
     "During the week of Monday 1 August, Camden Town station will be exit-only between 16:00 - 19:00 and if the station gets too busy, trains may not stop there. Customers will be guided to use nearby Mornington Crescent or Chalk Farm Tube stations.",
     "The track replacement work will also require changes to Northern line services over three weekends, when there will be no service between Hampstead / High Barnet / Mill Hill East and Charing Cross / Moorgate:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Saturday 30 and Sunday 31 July\",\"Saturday 6 and Sunday 7 August\",\"Saturday 20 and Sunday 21 August\"]}",
     "During the planned weekend closures, there will be replacement bus services along the route.",
     "David Hughes, London Underground's Director of Strategy, said: \"While Camden Town is one of the busiest junctions on the Tube network, it still relies on decades-old infrastructure. Replacing the tracks will improve reliability for our customers and will ensure we're prepared for the future.",
     "\"Though we try to carry out as much of our improvement work as possible when the Tube is closed, we need to make service changes this time to enable us to carry on behind the scenes. We're working hard to keep disruption to a minimum and we thank our customers for their patience while this vital upgrade is carried out.\"",
     "The work has been planned for August to coincide with the quieter summer period. For more weekday information and travel advice, customers are advised to visit tfl.gov.uk/northern-line-works and to follow @TfLTravelAlerts for live travel updates.",

To avoid delays drivers are advised to avoid areas near the event routes. More information and advice will be available on tfl.gov.uk/ridelondon.
