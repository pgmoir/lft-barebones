     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Quietway 1 runs 9km along traffic-free paths and quieter backstreets\",\"Route includes a number of important improvements for people walking and cycling, including a new 750m pedestrian and cycle link connecting South Bermondsey station and the Surrey Canal Road path over unused Network Rail land\"]}",
     "London's first Quietway route, a continuous sign-posted route linking Greenwich and Waterloo by quieter backstreet roads, is now open.",
     "The route passes through four London boroughs (Lambeth, Southwark, Lewisham and the Royal Borough of Greenwich) and includes more than 2km of traffic-free paths for cyclists and improved pedestrian facilities throughout. Pedestrians will benefit from new or improved crossing facilities and wider footways alongside the improvements for cyclists, which will make the route safer and more attractive for walking as well as cycling.",
     "Clearly marked with purple branded signage, Quietway 1 connects with other cycling routes in the area including the North-South Cycle Superhighway (CS6) at Webber Street and Cycle Superhighway 7 (CS7) at Great Suffolk Street. It passes many areas of local interest, opening them up to more pedestrians and cyclists, including Patterson Park and Bermondsey Spa in Southwark, through Deptford and into Greenwich, near to the DLR station.",
     "The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said:",
     "'It is important that we make it safer and easier for Londoners to cycle across our city and we want the first of the Quietways to make a significant contribution towards that aim. I am already looking at what works best from the existing cycle schemes to ensure we deliver the best and safest road cycling network possible. Cycling leads to a healthier lifestyle, it helps to cut pollution and is a key part of my vision of the type of greener, more modern and affordable transport network we need in our city.'",
     "The route has been delivered by Transport for London (TfL), the local boroughs and cycling and walking charity Sustrans. It is the first Quietway route to be delivered with six additional routes due to be complete by spring next year.",
     "Ben Plowden, TfL's Director of Surface Strategy and Planning, said:",
     "'We're really pleased to see the first Quietway, from Greenwich to Waterloo, open and ready for cyclists and pedestrians to use. The Quietway programme along quieter backstreets will help open up a whole new area of London for people walking and cycling and support non-polluting and healthy travel for commuting or leisure.'",
     "Matt Winfield, Deputy Director of Sustrans, said:",
     "'Quietway 1 provides a direct, quick and safe link from Greenwich into Waterloo, and points between. It is another important step in improving the quality of life and economic resilience in our world leading city. We are particularly pleased with the scheme designed and delivered at Millwall Football Club, providing a more direct and car free route for both cyclists and walkers, and a crucial link in this highly useful route.'",
     "Notes to Editors:",
