     "The latest bus safety statistics, for January to March 2016, show that 1,399 people were injured in incidents involving buses.  That represents a six per cent reduction on the previous quarter (September to December 2015) when 1,488 injuries were recorded.  Eighty-seven per cent of the injuries in the first quarter of this year were classified as minor and of those 74 per cent of people did not require hospital treatment.",

It is committed to publishing additional data analysing the most serious collisions by road user group\",\"Provide greater transparency on bus collision investigations - TfL has set out how fatal and serious injury collisions on the bus network are investigated and the processes that are followed by it, the bus operators and the police\",\"Deliver a new safety training module to all 24,700 drivers - TfL continues to invest in the most stringent bus driver training in the UK. By the end of this year bespoke 'In the Zone' training will have been delivered to all 24,700 bus drivers in the Capital. \\\"In the Zone\\\" raises drivers' awareness of the risks that road users take, whether that be as a driver of a vehicle, or as a vulnerable road user such as a pedestrian, cyclist or motorcyclist\"]}",
     "The overall trend for collisions involving a bus or coach where someone has been killed or seriously injured has reduced by 48 per cent over the last decade.",
     "Mike Weston, TfL's Director of Buses, said: `Whilst a reduction in injuries in the early part of this year is welcome, we are committed to working in partnership with bus operators to deliver the Bus Safety Programme to further improve safety.  The Sarah Hope Line will offer a comprehensive support service to anyone affected by an incident involving our services and more work will be undertaken this year on other aspects of the programme.  The continued publication of these statistics demonstrate our commitment to transparency and achieving this goal.\"",
