     "BT was fined a total of £3,250 and ordered to pay £1,800 in court costs.",
     "In passing sentence the Judge said: `This is not a one-off breach. I can see from records before me that these are regular occurrences despite the large number of fixed penalty notices issued by TfL. I understand no injuries occurred on this occasion but clearly more needs to be done to avoid these embarrassing prosecutions.'",
     "Garrett Emmerson, TfL's Chief Operating Officer for Surface Transport, said: `This is the second time in three weeks BT has been prosecuted for undertaking dangerous work and failing to provide required Streetworks notices. Ensuring that roadworks are carried out safely is vital, especially in a busy city such as London. BT is a repeat offender - having failed to manage roadworks properly on a number of occasions. We will always push for the strongest possible action in order to ensure London's streets are safe and free from unnecessary congestion.`",
