     "Statement by Mike Brown MVO, London's Transport Commissioner",
     "`Our thoughts are with everyone affected by what happened last Wednesday, and we are working with the local community to ensure that they continue to receive all the support they need at this incredibly difficult time.",
     "`I thank the RAIB for their thorough and swift interim investigation. Our engineers have now repaired all track and other equipment and have run trams over the repaired section.",
     "`We will follow the RAIB's advice and, before service is resumed, will implement additional temporary speed restrictions and associated signage near Sandilands to supplement existing safety arrangements.",
     "`We are continuing to carry out a thorough safety assessment and are taking the advice of an independent panel of tram experts. We will only resume services for the local community once that rigorous assurance process has been completed.'",
     "Additional Information",
     "The Sarah Hope Line is run by dedicated TfL staff to provide practical, financial and emotional help and can also make referrals for counselling and specialised support. The contact details for the Sarah Hope Line are 0343 222 5678, or incidentsupport@tfl.gov.uk.",
     "Tram services have been suspended between East Croydon and Harrington Road, Addington Village and Elmers End to enable the British Transport Police and Rail Accident Investigation Branch to thoroughly investigate the site and to allow TfL engineers to carry out repair work.",
     "Customers with any concerns or comments about the tram service can contact TfL 24 hours a day on: 0343 222 1234.",
     "Updates on progress towards the resumption of services will continue to be provided."
