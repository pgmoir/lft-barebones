     "Transport for London (TfL) today launched a new set of Poems on the Underground to be displayed in Tube train carriages across London. The poems are in support of the award-winning #LondonIsOpen campaign, which was introduced by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, to show the world that London remains open, entrepreneurial, international, and full of creativity and possibility.",
     "The six new poems highlight the diversity of the Capital. All of the works are set in London but celebrate the extensive range of voices and cultures that exist within the city - from Europe, Asia and the Caribbean as well as the UK.",
     "The poems featured are:",

     "Eleanor Pinfield, Head of Art on the Underground, said: 'Poems on the Underground consistently brings an exciting range of poetry to London. Through the diverse voices of this selection, we show millions of people that London is open - to creativity, to internationalism, to the world.'",
     "Judith Chernaik, writer, editor and founder of Poems on the Underground, said: 'We are delighted to support the Mayor's campaign with a set of Tube poems celebrating the wonderful diversity of London's people and places, all included in a leaflet of London Poems on the Underground free to the public at Tube stations and public libraries.'",
     "Poems on the Underground, founded in 1986, aims to bring poetry to a wider audience. It showcases a combination of classical, contemporary and international works in Tube train carriages across London. The programme helps to make journeys more stimulating, and has inspired similar displays in cities around the world, from New York and Paris to Moscow and Shanghai.",
