     "Following the tragic events in Croydon last week, tram services have today resumed across the whole tram network.",
     "Prior to resuming, and in accordance with advice in the Rail Accident Investigation Branch's (RAIB's) interim report into the derailment, additional speed restrictions and associated signage have been introduced near Sandilands.  These precautionary measures have also been implemented at three other locations on the tram network.",
     "All tram drivers were fully briefed prior to resumption and additional staff from Transport for London (TfL) and FirstGroup will be available across the network to provide support and information for customers and employees. FirstGroup will also be carrying out enhanced speed monitoring across the tram network.",
     "Engineers have repaired all track and other equipment and have run trams over the repaired section.  TfL has carried out a thorough safety assessment and has taken the advice of an independent panel of tram experts as part of a rigorous safety assurance process before resuming the service.",
     "Support is being offered to the families of those who lost their lives or who were injured.  This includes the services of TfL's Sarah Hope line, which offers practical, financial and other support.",
     "Mike Brown MVO, London's Transport Commissioner, said:",
     "`Our thoughts are with everyone affected by what happened last Wednesday, and we are doing everything we can to ensure that they receive support at this incredibly difficult time.",
     "`Following the RAIB's interim investigation, we have implemented their advice on additional speed restrictions and signage and carried out a rigorous safety assessment prior to restoring services today.\"",

     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Tram services had been suspended between East Croydon and Harrington Road, Addington Village and Elmers End to enable the British Transport Police and RAIB to thoroughly investigate the site and to allow TfL engineers to carry out repair work.\",\"As a precautionary measure, and in keeping with the RAIB's advice, TfL has imposed a further speed restriction before the existing 20 kmph section near Sandilands. A new 60kmph limit has been introduced between the 80kmph limit and the 20kmph limit. The 20kmph limit has also been brought closer to the exit of the tunnel.\",\"Similar restrictions have been implemented at three further locations on the tram network:  in the opposite direction between Sandilands and Lloyd Park;  on the approach to Sandilands from the Beckenham Junction / Elmers End branch;  and on the bend between Birkbeck and Harrington Road.\",\"The independent panel of tram experts was convened by UK Tram, the organisation representing the tram industry in the UK. These experts included an ex RAIB \\u0026 HMRI (Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate) inspector, the ex UK Operations Managing Director for Centro, the ex Managing Director of London Rail, an expert in driver training and the General Manager of UK Tram with an engineering and operations background.\",\"Anyone with concerns or comments about the tram service can contact TfL 24 hours a day on: 0343 222 1234.\",\"The Sarah Hope Line is run by dedicated TfL staff to offer practical, financial and other help as needed.  The contact details for the Sarah Hope Line are 0343 222 5678, or \\u003ca href=\\\"http://incidentsupport@tfl.gov.uk\\\"\\u003eincidentsupport@tfl.gov.uk\\u003c/a\\u003e .\"]}"
