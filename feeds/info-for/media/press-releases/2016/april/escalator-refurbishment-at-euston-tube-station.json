     "TfL is advising customers who use Euston Underground station that the refurbishment of four escalators will begin next week, on Thursday 14 April, and will be completed in July 2017.",
     "The escalators will be refurbished one at a time and will mean a more reliable service for customers in the future, as the Tube is expected to carry ever more passengers.",
     "While the work is carried out there will be limited access to the Northern and Victoria lines. Customers should allow extra time for their journey as the station will be very busy, especially during morning and evening peaks.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"An alternative journey\"}",
     "For an alternative journey, customers are advised to use local bus services to nearby King's Cross St. Pancras station for the Victoria line or the Northern line via Bank. For the Northern line via Charing Cross, Warren Street is a short walk away.",
     "Peter McNaught, Operations Director for London Underground, said: 'I'm sorry for the disruption the escalator refurbishment will cause to customers but I can reassure them that we have plans in place so that any disruption to their journeys is kept to a minimum.",
     "'Refurbishing these escalators is essential to make sure they work reliably for the thousands of people who use the station every day.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"60,000 customers\"}",
     "Around 60,000 customers use Euston Underground station daily. Escalators on the Underground are longer and heavier duty than most.",
     "They can carry huge volumes of people and run for around 20 hours a day.",
     "Redevelopment work to increase capacity at key stations and make them step-free is also underway at a number of other stations including Victoria, Tottenham Court Road and Bond Street.",
     "More than half of London Underground's 270 stations have now been modernised or refurbished to make them brighter and easier to use, with improvements such as tactile strips, better CCTV and help points, electronic information displays in ticket halls and on platforms, and improved seating and lighting."
