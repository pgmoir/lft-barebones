     "Transport for London (TfL) today launched a new map, which provides coach drivers with information on parking in the Capital, special arrangements outside popular tourist attractions and general advice on driving in London.",
     "The publication comes as TfL trials the use of dual purpose parking bays which are primarily loading bays and can also be used to set down and pick up coach passengers. Five new dedicated coach parking bays will be opened this year, two on Park Lane and three on the Albert Embankment.",
     "Our intention is that 21 of the Capital's 27 short-stay bays will also have their coach parking time increased from 20 minutes to 60 minutes. This will enable drivers to use them when taking their 45-minute rest period as required by law.",
     "Ben Plowden, TfL's Director of Surface Strategy and Planning, said: `This new map is being delivered in time to help during the busiest time of the year for the coach and tourism industry. We want to make it easier to drive and park a coach in central London because we recognise that tourism makes a major contribution to our economy and we will support that as much as possible.",
     "`London is growing, our roads are changing and there are more people than ever in the city. We are working continuously to improve on-street provision for coaches and looking at innovative ways to make the best us of available space. Work is on-going and, as these changes are incremental, we urge drivers to check the new map and our TfL website regularly before they travel to keep pace with those changes.'",
     "Simon Posner, Chief Executive of the Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT), said: `This map is really the 'Parking Bible' for all coach drivers in London and I would like to thank and congratulate all those involved in its production. There is no doubt that London needs coaches so we have to remember that coaches need somewhere to park.",
     "`Land and road space are at a higher premium than ever in the Capital and this puts pressure on coach operators. We are very appreciative of all TfL does to support our operations we look forward to working together to improve coach parking facilities even more.'",
