     "London Overground's South Tottenham Station has become the latest on the network to become step-free, following the installation of two new lifts as part of a Â£2.5 million programme to refurbish the station.",
     "The 600,000 passengers using the station each year will now benefit from the lifts and new walkways that will provide step-free access from platform to street but also, when final work is completed later this month, a new entrance and bike stand area outside the station. Further improvements include upgraded CCTV, a new gateline and staff will also benefit from larger working space and improved facilities.",
     "Mike Stubbs, Director, London Overground, said: `These new lifts will transform accessibility at South Tottenham station, benefitting families with young children and disabled people, as well as bringing a much improved journey to thousands of Londoners every day.\"'",
     "A huge range of improvements have already been made to transform transport accessibility across the Capital, including the introduction of manual boarding ramps and a turn up and go service, wide aisle gates, tactile paving and raised platform sections to give level access to the train on both the London Overground and London Underground network.\u003cbr /\u003eENDS",
     "Notes to Editors",
