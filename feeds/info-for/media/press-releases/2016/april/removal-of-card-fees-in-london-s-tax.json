     "Customers using cards no longer have to pay a surcharge on their taxi fare. This means that passengers should never pay more than the amount shown on the meter because of the method they use to pay. The previous cost of paying by card was £1 or 10 per cent of the fare, whichever was greater.",
     "All London licensed taxis will be required to accept card payments including contactless in October, following a decision by the Transport for London (TfL) Board in February.",
     "To compensate drivers for costs associated with accepting cards there has been an increase of 20 pence on the minimum fare, bringing it to £2.60",
     "Other changes to fares include:",

Previously passengers paid a higher fare when the meter reached a fixed amount. This tariff will be now start at a fixed distance (6 miles) - giving greater certainty over the fare, regardless of traffic conditions\"]}",
     "In addition, TfL has launched a new phone line and online feedback facility, which allows people using both taxi and private hire services to provide comments and suggestions, and helps TfL to respond effectively to any issues or complaints.",
     "Garrett Emmerson, TfL's Chief Operating Officer for Surface Transport, said: 'We are pleased to be able to reduce the cost for taxi passengers paying by card, as people now use them in every aspect of their lives. The acceptance of these types of payments in all taxis from October will be a huge plus for Londoners, visitors and drivers.",
     "'We also know that customers want to be able to contact us quickly and easily when they have an issue, want to pass on a commendation or tell us how we can do things better. The new helpline and online feedback facility allows people using both private hire and taxi vehicles to do this.'",
