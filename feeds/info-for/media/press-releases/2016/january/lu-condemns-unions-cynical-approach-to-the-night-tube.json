     "In response to calls for further strikes by the ASLEF, RMT and UNITE union leaderships, Steve Griffiths, Chief Operating Officer for London Underground (LU), said:",
     "'The unions' position is absurd and detached from the real world. Apparently, above-inflation pay rises, the creation of 700 more Tube jobs and the total protection of the work-life balance of existing staff are grounds for strikes.",
     "'The truth is that they expect our customers to pay for their excessive demands for even more money, fewer hours and a four day week. No employer could allow this and strike action will change nothing. There is no more money.",
     "'Our four year pay offer is extremely fair and we have gone the extra mile to fully protect the work-life balance of all our staff.  We will have hired around 700 additional staff, which gives total protection of work-life balance.  This is precisely what the unions have asked for, making their call for strikes even more astonishing.",
     "'The unions also attempt to justify their position on a lack of engagement with them. This too is nonsense. We have held numerous meetings with the unions since October 2014, including with the conciliation service ACAS.'",
     "'London needs a Night Tube service and we have made all of the running to implement it fairly. The only thing standing in the way is union intransigence.'",
     "The salary for a Tube driver is £49,673, with 43 days annual leave.  The salary for a customer service assistant is £30,000, rising to £50,000 for a station supervisor, with 52 days annual leave.",
     "LU is creating 700 new jobs to run the Night Tube service - offering total protection of work-life balance - over 6,000 people have applied for the new roles.",
     "Notes to Editors:",
     "The four year pay offer consists of:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Year 1 an average of 2 per cent;\",\"Years 2 and 3 would remain at RPI or 1 per cent, whichever is greater;\",\"Year 4 would be RPI plus 0.25 per cent.\",\"LU will also offer a £500 bonus for all staff on Night Tube lines.\"]}",
     "LU is hiring new drivers to run the Night Tube, which means that no current driver will have to work the Night Tube unless they want to.",
     "LU will not be changing any existing terms and conditions through the delivery of the Night Tube - the new drivers will be hired on permanent, part-time contracts with the same rates of pay and the same benefits as existing drivers.",
     "The Night Tube will cut night-time journeys by an average of 20 minutes, with some cut by more than an hour. It will also play a vital role in opening up London's night-time economy, supporting almost 2,000 permanent jobs and boosting the economy by £360m.",
     "Demand for a 24-hour Tube service is clear - late night Tube use has increased at double the rate of day-time trips and night bus usage has risen by 173 per cent since 2000. There are already over half a million users of the Tube after 22:00 on Fridays and Saturdays."
