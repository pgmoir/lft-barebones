     "Old Street Tube station will be home to a series of festivals as part of the station's pop-up revolution that has brought unique retail experiences to the thousands of people who use it each day.",
     "The new line-up will see a roster of secret events, new retail concepts and a whole host of experiences for customers to discover at the station each quarter, beginning this month with a Health and Wellbeing Festival. The space is being curated by Appear Here, the largest online marketplace for short-term retail space who TfL has appointed to introduce pop-up shops across its retail estate.",
     "The transformation of the retail offer at Old Street station is part of TfL's Commercial Development plans to generate Â£3.4bn in non-fares revenue over the next decade to reinvest into maintaining and modernising the transport network.",
     "Justin Brand, Director of Commercial Asset Management at TfL, said: `Since we launched Old Street Tube station as our pop-up retail destination, over 200 retailers have set up shop there, bringing some fantastic services and products to the 23 million people who use the station each year.",
     "`The new line up of retailers at the station will showcase some of the best brands around. The revenue that we generate from the retailers is reinvested into our transport network to deliver improved services for customers.'",
     "In April 2014, Transport for London announced Old Street Tube station as its first pop-up retail destination as part of its plans to modernise London Underground and introduce new services that customers want alongside long standing retailers.",
     "TfL appointed Appear Here in 2014 to manage the letting of its pop-up retail units at the station. Since then, over 200 retailers including American Eagle, Microsoft, Jamie Oliver and innovative small independents, such as Sourced Market, Propercorn and Press Lon-don have taken up residency at the station.  Press London and Supernatural have since take up permanent retail units at other stations on TfL's network.",
