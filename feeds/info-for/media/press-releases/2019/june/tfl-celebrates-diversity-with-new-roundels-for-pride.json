     "The Mayor of London and Transport for London (TfL) celebrate Pride this year with a trio of inclusive roundels ahead of Pride in London on Saturday 6 July. For the first time ever, the Bi Pride roundel can be seen across the transport network alongside the now iconic colours of the rainbow and Trans Pride flags to celebrate the LGBT+ community.",
     "To reflect the diversity of sexualities and gender identities, the ever-popular rainbow roundel returns with additional black and brown stripes to mark the representation of the BAME LGBT+ community. The new Bi Pride roundel uses the pink and purple colours of the Bisexual Pride flag, and the light blue and pink stripes of the Trans Pride flag represent the transgender community.  All three roundels will carry the hashtag #EveryStoryMatters.",
     "TfL will also participate in UK Black Pride on 7 July in Haggertson Park. The LGBT+ and BAME staff network groups will be on hand to discuss hate crime reporting, and reassure community groups, customers and staff that if they experience hostility, they should report it to the police who will investigate.",
     "This year, tote bags, pin badges, baseball caps and t-shirts displaying the Pride roundel will also be available to win on TfL's social media channels. Follow @TfL on Twitter and @TransportforLondon on Instagram for more information. For anyone who misses out on the giveaway, the merchandise will also be available to buy at the London Transport Museum.",
     "Tube station posters will feature photographs of TfL staff and partners, encouraging people to be proud of who they are and showing their support for the LGBT+ community.",
     "This year's initiative builds on TfL's strong legacy in supporting Pride, following the introduction of diversity traffic signals and range of rainbow-wrapped vehicles on the transport network.",
     "Last year saw the launch of an LGBT+ Allies group at TfL for members of staff who would like to learn more about LGBT+ issues and support the LGBT+ community. This group has increased awareness and provided employees with a forum to ask questions and share advice, providing a more inclusive environment for staff and customers.",

     "'London is a place where you can be who you want to be and love who you want to love. The Pride roundels, celebrating LGBT+ Londoners of all races, backgrounds, sexual orientations and gender identities, will show visitors from across the world that everyone is welcome here and London is truly open to all. I know this year's Pride will be another bold and vibrant celebration of London's LGBT+ community which plays such an important role in shaping the culture of our city.'",
