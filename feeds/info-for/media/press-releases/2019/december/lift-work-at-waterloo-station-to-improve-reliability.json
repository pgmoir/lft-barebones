     "Transport for London (TfL) is pre-warning customers that from Monday 6 January step-free access at Waterloo Tube station will be unavailable to enable essential maintenance to be carried out on the Jubilee line lift. The lift will return to service and step-free access restored on Saturday 18 January. During the work the rest of the station, including stairs and escalators, will continue to operate as normal.",
     "This maintenance work, which will include replacing the suspension ropes, will help to keep the lift in full working order for at least the next five years. All lifts on the London Underground get a routine maintenance check every two weeks, a full MOT every six months and a partial refurbishment every five years. They are then fully replaced every 10 to 20 years, depending on the type. The lift at Waterloo was installed in 2014 and this will be the first time it has been closed for substantial maintenance.",

The work will be done as quickly as possible and we will do all we can to help people with accessibility needs while the Jubilee line lift is not available. The essential maintenance will help keep the lift in good working order for the next five years at least.'",
     "Customers with accessibility needs, heavy luggage or children in buggies who would usually take the lift to access the Jubilee line and cannot use escalators will be advised not to get on or off at Waterloo but to use nearby Tube stations and take a local bus to continue their journey.",
     "There will be announcements on Jubilee line trains and throughout Waterloo Underground and mainline station. Posters have been displayed and emails sent to customers. Staff will be on hand at Waterloo and at Westminster, Southwark and London Bridge to help customers continue their journey.",
