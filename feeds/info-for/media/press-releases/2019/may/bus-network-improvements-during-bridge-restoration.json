     "\u003cbr /\u003ePlans for a new bus route and changes to six others have been published today to reduce the impact of the Hammersmith Bridge closure.Â  Bus services were immediately rerouted after the Grade II* listed Hammersmith Bridge was closed on safety grounds in April. As buses will not use Hammersmith Bridge until major safety-critical strengthening work is completed, Transport for London (TfL) has made improvements to local bus services.",
     "The changes will restore links for bus customers affected by the emergency closure of the bridge. They will:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Provide direct links between Roehampton, Mortlake and Barnes and the Tube network at Putney Bridge\",\"Provide a new direct link between Barnes and Hammersmith\",\"Reinstate the full route 72 north of the river\"]}",
     "The changes will be introduced on Saturday 18 May. They will be kept under close review and TfL welcomes any feedback on the changes.",
     "TfL and Hammersmith \u0026 Fulham Council are working extremely closely together to restore the 132-year-old bridge.",
     "Geoff Hobbs, Director of Public Transport Service Planning at TfL, said:",
     "'We had to reshape bus services in the area as a result of the bridge closure, but now we are able to finesse our changes to reduce its impact on customers. We urge customers to check how their journeys may be affected by visiting our website.",
     "'We are working closely with the council's specialist engineers to conclude the final plan, and finalise costs, for upgrading the bridge as soon as possible.'",
     "TfL is also working to manage the impact that the closure is having on the road network. It has already begun making changes to traffic signal timings in the area to help the flow of traffic and will continue to monitor the situation to determine whether further changes are required.",
     "Customers who use routes 33, 72, 419, 485 or 209 will experience a change in their journeys and should check before they travel. TfL will increase the capacity of the 265 and introduce a new route 533 between Barnes and Hammersmith via Chiswick Bridge. Customers who will need to change buses can do so at no extra cost within an hour of their first journey due the Mayor's Bus Hopper. To ensure bus customers are aware of the changes TfL is running a localised communication campaign. Maps demonstrating the changes will be displayed at affected routes and published on TfL's website and social media channels. Registered customers of affected routes will receive emails detailing the changes and bus drivers will inform passengers of the alterations. TfL will also work with the council to ensure that local stakeholders are contacted. Further details of the changes can be found on TfL's website.",
     "Keeping local authority infrastructure in good condition is essential to ensure the wider road network stays safe and efficient and helps the economy grow. Certainty of a long-term steady and sustained Government funding arrangement is needed to allow London to cover the costs of its own infrastructure maintenance.",
     "Notes to Editors:",
