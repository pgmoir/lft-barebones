     "TfL today announced that a contract for London Underground track renewals will be awarded to Balfour Beatty.",
     "The contract, worth around Â£220m, encompasses all aspects of track renewal - including track, points and crossings, and trackside drainage - and will help to ensure value for money and a strong focus on safety.",
     "The contract will start in April 2019 and last for four years, with an option included to extend the contract for up to a further six years. London Underground track assets include track drainage, depots and long timber bridges as well as elements like rails, points and sleepers.",
     "There is 1,047km of track across the network, 17% of which is in non-customer areas like depots and sidings. Track renewal plays a vital role in supporting line upgrades and maintaining day-to-day service levels to meet the demands of intense train service patterns, as well as addressing issues with noise and vibration by keeping track in a good condition.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Vital role\"}",
     "Caroline Sheridan, London Underground's Director for Renewals \u0026 Enhancements, said: 'Track maintenance and renewal is an essential part of keeping London moving.",
     "'This contract will help us to continue to provide better, more reliable journeys for our customers, while continuing to drive staff safety.'",
     "Mark Bullock, Balfour Beatty's Chief Executive Officer for its Rail and Utilities business, said: 'This award is testament to our continued focus on driving innovative solutions that deliver sustainable, safer rail infrastructure at reduced cost.",
     "'Utilising our deep knowledge and unrivalled expertise of the rail infrastructure market, we will continue to upgrade this renowned underground network and keep London moving.'",
     "David Wylie, TfL's Chief Procurement Officer, said: 'This contract is designed to promote a strong working relationship between London Underground and Balfour Beatty.",
     "'The contract has incentives built in that create a strong focus on safe and reliable delivery allowing TfL to maintain the best possible safety standards and ensuring a reliable service for its customers. The agreement also encourages consistent improvement and innovation while controlling costs.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Value for money\"}",
     "The contract replaces a previous eight-year agreement with Balfour Beatty which contributed to modernising around 75 per cent of the Tube network. TfL's comprehensive and strict procurement process evaluated key criteria focused on safety, behaviours, delivery expertise and value for money.",
     "The continued modernisation of the Tube is a key part of the Mayor's Transport Strategy to make London a greener, more accessible place.",
     "The investment in improving public transport will help reduce reliance on the car and contribute to the Mayor's target of 80% of journeys made by public transport, cycling or walking by 2041.",
