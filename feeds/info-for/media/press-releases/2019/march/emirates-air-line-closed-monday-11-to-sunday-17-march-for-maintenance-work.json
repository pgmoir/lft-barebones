     "TfL is advising customers that the Emirates Air Line, London's urban cable car, will be closed from Monday 11 to Sunday 17 March 2019 for essential planned maintenance.",
     "The cable car has had over 10.7 million passengers since opening and, like all other cable car systems around the world, it must undergo maintenance each year.",
     "As in previous years, the work will be carried out by operator Mace Macro with assistance from Doppelmayr, the company that built the cable car system and has been involved in the operations and maintenance since it opened.",
     "The primary work this year will involve replacing the bearing in the bullwheel, which provides tension to the cable, at the south station on the Greenwich Peninsula side of the river.",
     "This will involve removing the tension from the cable so the bullwheel can be lowered to the station floor where work will take place.",
     "The hydraulic and braking systems at both the north and south terminals will be serviced, along with electrical equipment in each of the cabins.",
     "TfL will be posting pictures of the work on social media throughout the week to keep customers updated.",
     "Dave Fisher, TfL's Head of the Emirates Air Line, said: 'Since opening in 2012, over ten million passengers have enjoyed a unique and spectacular ride on the UK's first urban cable car, including over 1.3 million passengers in the last year alone.",
     "'Our planned maintenance week ensures that the Emirates Air Line can continue to run a safe and reliable service for all of our customers.",
     "'We apologise for any disruption this causes. However, by carrying out all this vital work now, the Emirates Air Line will not require any further planned closures this year.'",
     "While the closure is in place, the nearest alternative public transport is North Greenwich Tube station for the Jubilee line on the south side of the river and Royal Victoria DLR station on the north side.",
     "Both are a short walk away from the Emirates Air Line. River services operate from North Greenwich Pier next to the Emirates Greenwich Peninsula terminal. Bus services are also available from North Greenwich bus station and Royal Victoria.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Regeneration in the area\"}",
     "At around 90 metres tall, the Emirates Air Line is a prime location to enjoy spectacular views of the city including the Thames Barrier, the O2, St Paul's Cathedral, and the Olympic Park. It also overlooks the substantial regeneration that is taking place in the area.",
     "Greenwich Peninsula (a former disused gasworks) is owned by the Greater London Authority and there are plans to deliver more than 17,000 new homes and 1000s of new jobs to create an entire new district formed of five neighbourhoods.",
     "The regeneration will see new retail uses, office and light industrial workspace, new hotels and schools, cultural and leisure activities, and new public open space.",
     "All of this will create a vibrant place to live with excellent transport links including the Jubilee Line and North Greenwich Pier as well as the Emirates Airline linking the Greenwich Peninsula to London's Royal Docks.",
     "The Royal Docks is also a unique waterfront location and growing destination for business and culture. The area has a rich heritage and is home to global businesses, major events and water sports.",
     "Over the next 20 years, 25,000 new homes and 60,000 new jobs will be created in the Royal Docks area, which is well connected and will soon have its own Elizabeth Line station and an improved DLR service.",
     "These investments in addition to new and improved public spaces and an exciting cultural offer make this one of London's most significant regeneration projects.",
