     "Construction work on a major new Cycleway in east London is set to begin this winter, as TfL outlines the next steps for plans which would transform neighbourhoods between Hackney and Westferry and enable thousands more journeys to be made on foot and by cycle.",
     "In May, TfL invited people to have their say on the plans, which would reduce danger to people walking and cycling and add 2km of protected space to London's growing network of cycle routes.",
     "The proposed Cycleway was the first new cycling route to be consulted on from TfL's Strategic Cycling Analysis, which used data to identify 25 areas which showed the best potential for growing cycling numbers.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Best potential\"}",
     "More than 1,800 people took part in the consultation and 91% thought that the proposals would boost the number of people cycling in the area. Nearly three quarters also thought that the changes would enable more people to make journeys in the area on foot.",
     "The upgrades will include:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Segregated cycle tracks on Burdett Road and West India Dock Road, providing a dedicated space for people who want to cycle\",\"Safety improvements along the route including improvements at junctions, traffic calming and a new 20mph speed limit along Burdett Road\",\"Two new signal-controlled pedestrian crossings and upgrades to existing pedestrian crossings along the route, making it easier and safer to cross the road\",\"New and improved public and green spaces, including new paving, trees and planting\",\"Links to existing cycling routes in Hackney and Tower Hamlets including Cycleways 2 and 3\",\"Changes to some bus stop layouts and locations, including introduction of new bus stop bypasses for people cycling\",\"Changing entry to and exit from some side roads along the route\",\"Road resurfacing providing improvements for people walking and cycling as well as for buses and general traffic\",\"Upgrading pavements to improve comfort for people walking\"]}",
     "TfL has listened to people's feedback on the proposals and made changes to the designs at two locations in response to comments.",
     "Subject to the approvals process, construction work on the first section of the route is set to begin this winter.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Major new Cycleway\"}",
     "Will Norman, London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, said: 'I'm delighted that construction work on this major new Cycleway is set to begin this winter.",
     "'The overwhelming support for the plans during the public consultation shows there is great demand for walking and cycling improvements which enable many more people to get around on foot or by bike as part of their everyday routine.",
     "'By reducing car use we will improve air quality for everyone, and reduce congestion.'",
     "David Hughes, TfL's Director of Investment Delivery Planning, said: 'Our plans in the area will transform local roads for walking and cycling, reducing road danger and helping to clean up London's toxic air.",
     "'We'd like to thank everybody who took part in our consultation for their invaluable feedback and are looking forward to construction work starting later this winter.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Millions more journeys\"}",
     "TfL is investing Â£2.3bn to enable millions more journeys to be made by walking and cycling as part of the Mayor's plans to tackle some of the biggest challenges facing the capital, including the global climate emergency, toxic air and obesity.",
     "In September, four new Cycleways were launched across London and construction on a number of major new routes is either under way or set to begin this year.",
     "Work on Cycleway 4 between Tower Bridge and Greenwich began in June, whilst work on Cycleway 9 between Brentford and Olympia is planned to start later this year.",
     "Construction work also continues on Cycleway 34 between North Acton and Wood Lane.",
