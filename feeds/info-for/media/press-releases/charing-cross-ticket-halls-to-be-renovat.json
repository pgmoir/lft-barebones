     "Transport for London (TfL) has announced that work to modernise the Northern line ticket hall at Charing Cross Station will begin on Monday 26 September.",
     "The 1970s ticket hall, which is the larger of two at Charing Cross, will be brought up to a modern standard. It will undergo a number of changes including new tiling and finishes, a new straightened gate line with more space at the top of the escalators and improvements to CCTV and lighting.â€Ž",
     "The modernisation work means that the Northern line ticket hall will be closed until July 2017.",
     "The smaller Bakerloo line ticket hall, which is currently similarly outdated, will also close for refurbishment from July 2017, after the Northern line ticket hall has reopened and will be closed until December 2017 for a similar refurbishment.",
     "During the work to the Northern line ticket hall, customers wishing to access the Northern line from the Network Rail station or from street level are advised to use Embankment station, a short walk from Charing Cross, which will be signposted, and customers wishing to access the Bakerloo line are advised to use Trafalgar Square.",
     "Mark Wild, Managing Director of London Underground, said: `The Northern line ticket hall at Charing Cross was opened in the 1970s, and now feels tired and unwelcoming.  This work will improve the ticket hall, making it bright, modern and a better place for our customers to pass through.  It will also make the station fit for the large number of passengers that pass through it every day and future-proof it as the demand on the Tube increases while London continues to grow.'",
     "Over 20 million passenger journeys are completed each year at Charing Cross, with over 62,500 journeys passing through the station every weekday.  The work at the station will also create new retail space and a new, larger entrance to the Northern line ticket hall.",
     "While the work is carried out, the underpass linking William IV Street and Adelaide Street to the Northern line ticket hall, which is owned by Westminster City Council, will be closed, but the shops inside will remain open.",
