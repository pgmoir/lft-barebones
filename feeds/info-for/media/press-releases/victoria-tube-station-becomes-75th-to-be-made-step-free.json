     "Transport for London (TfL) announced today that Victoria Tube station is now step-free, improving access to the transport network for millions of people.",
     "Seven new lifts have been installed at the underground station, making journeys step-free between the street and Victoria line trains and the District and Circle line platforms. Customers from the mainline station can now also travel step-free from trains to the Tube station and interchange more easily between the three Tube lines.",
     "The station is the fourth busiest station on the Underground, serving more than 79 million customers each year. The new lifts will help ensure the station is accessible to all customers, including disabled or older customers, parents or carers with buggies and people with heavy luggage. The new lifts are part of an upgrade project that has almost doubled the size of the station, with the very final work on the Tube station to be completed later this year.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eDeputy Mayor for Transport, Heidi Alexander, said:\u003c/strong\u003e \"Victoria Underground is one our busiest stations and one of the first major Tube stations encountered by visitors to the capital. The provision of step-free access marks a major milestone, as it provides greater access to the Underground as well as vital interchanges between Tube journeys and a seamless connection with National Rail services. We are improving step-free access across our network and we are determined to do all we can to ensure our customers experience all London has to offer.\"",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eRuth Duston OC, OBE, Chief Executive of the Victoria Business Improvement District (BID), said:\u003c/strong\u003e \"With more people working and visiting Victoria than ever it's important that our transport infrastructure keeps pace and continues to improve. The BID welcomes the completion of these vital improvement works, which will undoubtedly help make the experience of travelling to Victoria more pleasant and convenient.\"",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eTransport for All Chair, Alan Benson, said:\u003c/strong\u003e \"These eagerly anticipated lifts will transform the lives of not only disabled and older people but also the many tourists, visitors and Londoners who use this busy hub station. The challenges faced by our members to access the Underground in central London means that accessible key interchanges like this have a greater impact on their travel options. Using these lifts will open up opportunities for people to enjoy and contribute to vibrant London life where previously they have been excluded.\"\u003cbr /\u003e",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eDarren Williams, manager of Network Rail's Victoria Station, said:\u003c/strong\u003e \"To finally be able to give our passengers the ability to access the underground without having to leave the station is a fantastic milestone and another step forward for the station.\"",
