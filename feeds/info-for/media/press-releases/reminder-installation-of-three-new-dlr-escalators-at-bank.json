     "Transport for London (TfL) is reminding customers at Bank station that essential works to make way for the installation of three new escalators in the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) concourse starts next week (30th September).",
     "The milestone marks a crucial phase of the planned upgrade as the modernisation of Bank station continues to gather pace, with capacity set to increase by 40 per cent by 2022.",
     "The DLR concourse will be reduced to make way for the three new escalators to the Northern line, which will boost capacity and help to improve journeys through the station. A one-way system will be put in place with a new dedicated team of staff on hand to help customers familiarise themselves with the closure.",
     "Customers arriving on the Northern line will be able to reach the DLR by the existing fixed staircase. DLR customers wishing to interchange to the Northern line will be redirected by new signage, with staff on hand to assist where needed. DLR customers will be able to enter and exit Bank and Monument stations as usual, although to prevent the station becoming overcrowded staff may occasionally guide them through a different route.",
     "The escalator installation is a vital part of the station upgrade. Once ready for use in 2022, the escalators will make it easier for passengers to travel around the station, helping to reduce congestion when the new, higher-capacity DLR trains enter service in 2023.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eStuart Harvey, Director of Major Projects for TfL, said:\u003c/strong\u003e ",
     "'Demand at Bank Tube station has risen by around a quarter in recent years and the new escalators to the DLR from the Northern line are essential to managing this increase while making customer journeys quicker and more comfortable by increasing capacity. I apologise to customers who may be affected by the concourse closure. We have planned this work to minimise any disruption to customers and staff will be on hand to help people move around the station.'",
     "Improving the station is critical to keep London working and growing. Other benefits of the major Bank station upgrade work include:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"A new railway tunnel and platform for the Northern line that will reduce interchange times and create more space for passengers\",\"Step-free access to the Northern line and improved step-free access to the DLR platforms\",\"More direct routes within the station, with two new moving walkways helping to speed up interchange times\",\"Two new lifts and 12 new escalators\",\"A new station entrance on Cannon Street\"]}",
     "The station complex including both Bank and Monument is already one of the busiest on the network, with more than 120 million customers passing through it each year.",
     "The full Bank station modernisation project is now over half way to completion with more than 1000m of new tunnels having been built. Passenger disruption has been minimal throughout."
