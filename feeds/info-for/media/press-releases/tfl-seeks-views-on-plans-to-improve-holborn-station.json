     "There are four weeks remaining in a public consultation on Transport for London's (TfL's) proposals to modernise and improve Holborn Tube station.",
     "The proposed upgrade would see the station more than double in size and feature a new second station entrance and exit on Procter Street.",
     "Three new lifts in the existing Kingsway entrance would provide step-free access to both the Central and Piccadilly lines and new interchange routes between the two lines would greatly reduce crowding during peak periods.",
     "Holborn is currently the 11th busiest station on the London Underground, with around 63 million customers using the station every year.  By the 2030s, the number of passengers using the station is expected to rise by up to nearly 30 per cent and the station - designed in the early 1900s - needs to be upgraded to cope with growing demand.",
     "Mark Wild, the Managing Director of London Underground, said: \"Holborn is one of the busiest stations in London, with hundreds of thousands of people using it every day, and upgrading the station will make it more spacious and accessible.  It will also improve the only interchange between two of our busiest lines, the Central and Piccadilly lines.\"",
     "Tass Mavrogordato, CEO of BeeLondon, said: \"On behalf of the business community of Midtown we absolutely welcome TfL's expansion plans for the station and we, and the businesses we represent, are delighted to be taking part in this consultation phase.\"",
