     "Martyn Loukes, Business Development Manager and Chair of Transport for London's (TfL) LGBT+ staff network, OUTbound has been recognised with a British Empire Medal in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to TfL and the LGBT community.",
     "Since becoming Chair of OUTbound in May 2012, Martyn has cemented TfL's support for the LGBT community and Pride in London which saw the first ever rainbow-zebra crossing installed for the event in 2014.  Martyn brought together relevant highway authorities and event organisers and to secure corporate sponsorship to pay for it.",
     "Martyn has overseen a series of other firsts for the LGBT+ community in London, including the world's first rainbow bus which is in service on the route 8 between Bow Church and Tottenham Court Road. The famous rainbow livery was also featured on 75 cycle hire bikes and this year he was instrumental in introducing the first rainbow taxi service to London's streets, in support of the International day against Homophobia and Transphobia (IDAHOT).",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Sir Peter Hendy CBE said:\u003cbr /\u003e'Martyn has made a tremendous contribution to LGBT issues both in TfL and the wider community and has worked with tireless commitment.  The rainbow designs that have embellished our iconic transport vehicles in recent years have been a great symbol of the diversity of our great city.'",
     "Martyn Loukes, BEM said:\u003cbr /\u003e'I'm both amazed and honoured at receiving this award. When I joined TfL 11-years ago I had no idea that one day I'd be in charge of one of the UK's most high profile LGBT staff networks, OUTbound. In particular, our #RidewithPride campaign just goes to show what can be achieved through championing diversity at work and beyond.'",
     "Michèle Dix, Managing Director of Crossrail 2, collected her CBE for services to transport in London at Buckingham Palace today. She was presented the award by HRH The Prince of Wales having been recognised for her contribution to improving transport in the Capital in the Queen's New Year's Honours list in December.  Michèle was also awarded the Spirit of Everywoman award earlier this month for being a pioneer in the transport and logistics industry and received the Institution award from the Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation (CHIT) this week for her significant contribution to transport.",
     "Michèle's awards are especially celebratory as this year marks 100 Years of women working in transport, with women taking on operational roles in the First World War and being involved in building landmarks such as Waterloo Bridge, often dubbed the 'Ladies Bridge' which opened in December 1945.",
