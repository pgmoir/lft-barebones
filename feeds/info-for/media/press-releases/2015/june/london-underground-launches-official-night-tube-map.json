     "The new map has been designed to show customers clearly which Tube lines and stations will operate 24-hour services from the early hours of 12 September 2015, transforming night time journeys across London for millions of people.",
     "The Night Tube will mean Londoners and visitors to the Capital can travel on the following lines on Friday nights and the early hours of Saturday and Sunday mornings:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Central line: trains will run between Ealing Broadway and Hainault/Loughton;\",\"Jubilee line: trains will run on the entire line;\",\"Northern line: trains will run on the entire line except on the Mill Hill East and Bank branches;\",\"Piccadilly line: trains will run between Cockfosters and Heathrow Terminal 5;\",\"Victoria line: trains will run on the entire line.\"]}",
     "The Night Tube will transform night time journeys across London for millions of people, cutting journeys by an average of 20 minutes, with some cut by more than an hour. London's night-time economy will be opened up to a host of new opportunities, with the Night Tube supporting around 2,000 permanent jobs and boosting the economy by Â£360 million.",
     "As the most visited city in the world, London will be joining just a handful of other top world cities, including New York and Berlin, which also provide metro services through the night. The new services will help to maintain London's status as a vibrant and exciting place to live, work and visit.",
     "Gareth Powell, London Underground's Director of Strategy \u0026 Service Development, said: \"The introduction of the Night Tube is a historic step in our modernisation of the Underground.  The Night Tube map shows our customers exactly when and where they can use this landmark service, which will make their late night journeys quicker and easier than ever before. As well making life easier for people, the Night Tube will also boost London's night-time economy - supporting thousands of jobs and stimulating hundreds of millions of pounds in economic growth.\"",
     "Notes to Editors:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"The Night Tube map, and the full independent report into the economic benefits of the Night Tube, are available from the Night Tube webpages on the TfL website: \\u003ca href=\\\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/nighttube\\\"\\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk/nighttube\\u003c/a\\u003e \",\"To help build awareness for the launch of the Night Tube, TfL today launched an innovative advertising campaign which showcases the possibilities that the Night Tube will open up to Londoners and visitors. The campaign, which appears both digitally and in printed materials, will be seen around the Underground and Rail networks, buses, online, London wide media, and will also include a \\\"wrapped\\\" train on the Piccadilly line.\",\"The huge Tube improvement programme underway will continue, with billions of pounds of investment to deliver more frequent, reliable and accessible services and enhanced stations, providing greater capacity to tackle increasing numbers of customers.\",\"Some of the most frequent services anywhere in Europe now serve customers on the Victoria and Jubilee lines. Northern line customers have seen the capacity increased by 20 per cent following the modernisation of the line's signalling, which concluded this year.\",\"London Underground is modernising the way customers are served at stations, with staff brought out from underused ticket offices and back offices to where they can assist customers most effectively - in ticket halls, at gate lines and on platforms. Stations open during the Night Tube will remain staffed and controlled at all times, with staff supported by an extensive and visible police presence.\",\"Crime on the Tube network is at an all time low.  To ensure the safety and security of all staff and customers there will be an enhanced policing presence during the overnight services, which will include more than 100 officers out on visible patrol across the network.\"]}"
