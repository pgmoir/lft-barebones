     "Work that will help to increase the tram service between Wimbledon and Croydon by 50 per cent is due to start next month.",
     "The development, which is part of Transport for London's (TfL's) investment programme, will see a new tram platform built at Wimbledon and the arrival of four new trams - allowing 12 to run every hour along the busy route from Wimbledon to Croydon.",
     "To complete the work, and the new track layout, a short section of the route will be closed between Dundonald Road to Wimbledon from 13 July to October 2015.",
     "Sharon Thompson, Director of London Trams, said:",
     "'The tram enhancement work at Wimbledon is a vital development that will increase the capacity of London's tram network, which is much needed on this busy service. When complete in 2016, our customers will benefit from a more frequent service with the introduction of four new trams across the Wimbledon to West Croydon branch.",
     "'The tram platform at Wimbledon will need to be closed temporarily to finish the work. Passengers will need to allow some extra time to get to and from Dundonald Road during this period.'",
     "The tram network has experienced rapid growth in passenger numbers since it opened in 2000, from 18.5 million passengers in its first year of operation to over 32 million in 2014/15, and demand on the tram network is forecast to increase to around 60 million by 2030.",
     "A number of improvements have already been made, including a 700m section of track between Mitcham Junction and Beddington Lane and an additional 1000m of track between Mitcham and Mitcham Junction, which have removed bottlenecks and improved access.",
     "The improvements will also have a positive impact on other transport services in the area, helping to relieve congestion on buses and encouraging car owners to leave their vehicles at home - reducing traffic and carbon emissions.",
     "While the work at Wimbledon is being carried out, trams will not serve Wimbledon but will start and stop at Dundonald Road for three months. Dundonald Road is a 10 minute walk from Wimbledon station and there will be a clearly signposted walking route throughout the closure.  Valid tram tickets will also be accepted on local buses that connect Wimbledon with London's tram network. Customers for Merton Park are advised to use the 163 and 164 bus routes, customers for Morden Road are advised to use the 93 and for Phipps Bridge the 200 bus route. National Rail and District line services from Wimbledon will not be affected.",
     "Notes to Editors:",
