     "The proposal would provide a new service on Sundays for parts of Park Langley and Ravensbourne as well as links to TfL's tram network around Beckenham and Birkbeck.  Stopping arrangements on the new services, including existing hail and ride sections, would remain unchanged.",
     "Route 352 runs from Bromley North to Lower Sydenham via Hayesford Park and Beckenham, while route 354 runs from Bromley North to Penge via Ravensbourne and Birkbeck. Both routes currently run on Mondays to Saturdays only.",
     "This consultation can be accessed online here: https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/buses/bus-service-proposal-route-352-and-354.  The consultation will close on Friday 10 July 2015.",
     "Subject to the outcome of the consultation TfL is looking to introduce the Sunday services in September.",
     "This service change is part of TfL's management and development of a network that comprises of around 700 routes across Greater London, operated by 7,600 buses at peak times, carrying 2.4 billion passengers every year.  TfL keeps the network under regular review, working with the London boroughs and other partners to help ensure that services can respond to London's changing travel needs.",
     "Since TfL was formed in 2000 it has invested strongly in London's bus network - resulting in a 69 per cent increase in passenger numbers.  London Buses now carry 2.4 billion passengers a year, which equates to half of all bus journeys made in England.",
     "In recognition of the continued need to invest in bus services - with an increase in demand from the city's rapidly growing population - TfL's latest Business Plan has dedicated around £500m to improve the network over the period from 2015/16 to 2020/21.",
     "This will include funding for over 500 extra buses, which will create capacity for an extra 2.9 million customer journeys each week; as well as an additional £200m, which will be invested in supporting the reliability of the bus network at a local level.  A further £25m will be used to fund customer-focused bus driver training to improve customer service."
