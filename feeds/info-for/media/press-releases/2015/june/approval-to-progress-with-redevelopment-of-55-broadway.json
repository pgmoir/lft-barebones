     "Transport for London (TfL) has been given the green light for the redevelopment of London Underground's historic HQ - the Grade I listed 55 Broadway. Planning approval was granted at Westminster City Council's Planning Applications Committee on 16 June 2015.",
     "The decision means TfL can progress with plans to transform the iconic building from outdated offices to a landmark residential led development with affordable housing. The development will also include 1,308sqm of retained office space. The move to transform the building is part of TfL's continuing plans to generate £3.4bn in non-fare revenue over the next decade to reinvest back into the transport network for the benefit of customers and users.",
     "The approved plan details the delivery of 23.5 per cent affordable and social housing including family sized homes, which TfL has maximised within the development constraints, thus delivering one of the highest levels of on site affordable and social housing ever seen in this part of the borough.",
     "The plans will enable TfL to maintain the heritage of the building and reinstate Charles Holden's original design for the ground floor. The redevelopment will also increase the amount and quality of the retail space at St James's Park Tube station.",
     "Graeme Craig, Director of Commercial Development at TfL, said:",
     "'TfL is one of the largest landowners in London. I am delighted that 55 Broadway can now be brought forward for development, generating significant sums to reinvest back into the transport network whilst helping us bear down on fares. The building is a part of our heritage, and its redevelopment will also enable us to preserve and enhance its historic features.'",
     "Charles Holden designed the building between 1927 and 1929, and it was constructed as a new headquarters for the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), the main forerunner  of London Underground.",
     "The redevelopment is part of TfL's wider commercial plans to maximise the value of its assets to generate long-term revenue to reinvest back into the transport network. In January 2015, TfL launched a tender process to identify a number of property development partners to work with on 50+ sites across London. In March of this year, TfL received over 50 responses from a broad range of property companies. TfL has now shortlisted 16 companies and they will undergo further evaluation and a select number will be invited to submit final tenders.",
     "In May 2014, TfL appointed TateHindle as its architects for 55 Broadway following a Competitive Dialogue Procurement Process under the OJEU (Official Journal of the European Union) process.",
