     "The new permanent wall protects the land and trees behind it from falling on to the road, providing safety for pedestrians and other road users. It replaces the original 1920s structure which, since 2010, had been supported by a temporary frame - closing the footpath to pedestrians.",
     "The 200m long reinforced concrete structure now features an additional 'green' wall incorporating more than 10 plant species - helping to breathe life into the area and improve the local environment.",
     "The wall forms part of TfL's continuing work to introduce new trees and plants, especially along major road corridors, to help improve air quality across the Capital. The construction, in partnership with TfL's contractors BAM Nuttall, took around eight months to complete and was finished without having to close the A406.",
     "Dana Skelley, Director of Asset Management for Surface Transport at TfL, said:",
     "'Replacing the retaining wall along the A406 North Circular Road was a significant job, ensuring that this vital section of road can remain safe to use for many years to come. It's great that we have been able to reopen the footpath for pedestrians and provide a green wall, delivering further benefits for local residents as well as drivers along the A406.'",
     "Cllr Dean Cohen, Ward Member for Golders Green and Chairman of Barnet Council's Environment Committee, said:",
     "'I'm pleased that these works have finally been completed and enable the re-opening of the walkway, which will provide safe access for pedestrians. The green wall will also serve to improve both local air quality and the look of the area. We will continue to work with TfL on delivering improvements to our local road network.'",
     "These works form part of TfL's Â£4bn Road Modernisation Plan, which represents the biggest investment in London's roads in a generation. Hundreds of transformational projects across the road network will make the Capital a better place to live, work and travel.",
