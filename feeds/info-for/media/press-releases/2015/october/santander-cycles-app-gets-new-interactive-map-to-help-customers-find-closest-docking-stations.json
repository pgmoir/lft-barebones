     "The popular Santander Cycles app has been updated to make it even easier for customers to use.",
     "Following the upgrade, users of the app can now scroll across the docking station map, helping them easily and accurately plot routes across London and find docking stations close by.",
     "The new updates were implemented based on comments from users through the app stores and social media channels.",
     "Cyclists can view their nearest docking station and availability of bikes, as well as hire a bike by getting a 'release code' straight to their phone. This means anyone can now hire a Santander Cycle without having to use the on-street docking station.",

     "The free app, commissioned by TfL, Santander and Serco and developed by Corethree, has proven popular since it was launched in May with more than 120,000 downloads.",
     "James Mead, General Manager of Santander Cycles, said: 'Around 2,500 bikes a day are now hired using the app, which is a fantastic step forward for the scheme - it's great to see so many people using it.",

     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Strength-to-strength\"}",
     "Ashley Murdoch, CEO of Corethree said: 'Developing the Cycle Hire application with Serco, TfL \u0026 Santander has been a very rewarding project for Corethree.",
     "'We have been delighted by the impressive download numbers of the app.  It's interesting to see how people are using the bikes too, using our powerful data collection and reporting system.",
     "'We look forward to watching the user numbers grow and working closely as a team to add further features over time.'",
     "London's Cycle Hire scheme has grown from strength-to-strength since launching in July 2010, with now almost double the number of bikes (6,000 to 11,500).",
     "Nearly 45 million journeys have been made in the five years of the scheme, with a record 73,000 hires made in one day, and more than seven and a half million hired during 2015 already.",
