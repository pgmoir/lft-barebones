     "London Underground's Managing Director, Nick Brown, made the announcement during a visit to the factory floor with Nicky Morgan, MP for Loughborough.",
     "The Brush name has been synonymous with quality engineering and the supply of railway and public transport equipment since 1865. The £6.5m contract will see the company working on trains for the Piccadilly line which sees around 200 million passenger journeys per year. The Piccadilly line will be the first to have the modern, air-cooled New Tube for London trains in service around 2022.",
     "Nick Brown said: `Brush Traction is playing an important role in the modernisation of London's transport network and is helping us to meet the unprecedented demand created by the city's success and rapid population growth. Suppliers like them keep London working and growing and help us to support the national economy. We have invested more than £865m with suppliers across the Midlands over the past year and we are always interested in hearing from other suppliers across the UK to see how they could work with us.'",
     "During the visit Nicky Morgan, MP for Loughborough, said: `I am thrilled that Transport for London has awarded this contract to Brush Traction - a company renowned for their work on completely refurbishing trains, based here in Loughborough. It is fantastic news for both Brush and for Loughborough, and of course for Transport for London!'",
     "Around 60% of TfL expenditure is spent with suppliers based outside London and this supports approximately 60,000 jobs in a supply chain stretching the length and breadth of the country. More than 19,500 jobs have been supported in the Midlands alone while over 5,700 apprenticeships have also been created nationwide by TfL and the supply chain.",
     "Wabtec UK Managing Director, Chris Weatherall, said: `We are delighted to be awarded this further contract with TfL. Wabtec companies have supported TfL for many years and we look forward to continuing our long association with this key customer for many years to come.'",
     "After the Brush Traction factory visit Nick Brown held an event at Loughborough University to meet other potential suppliers from the Midlands.",
