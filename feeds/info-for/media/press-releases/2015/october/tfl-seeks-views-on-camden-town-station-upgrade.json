     "Camden Town station is one of the busiest interchange stations on the Underground network.  Over 80,000 people already use it every day and it is set to increase by 60 per cent over the coming years as London's success continues to drive rapid population growth.",
     "To meet this demand, and make journeys through the station easier for customers, a wide range of improvements are proposed. These benefits could include:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"A new second entrance and exit to the station;\",\"Three new escalators;\",\"Step-free access from the street to trains, with two new lifts;\",\"More space to change between trains;\",\"The station remaining open during busy periods and removing the need for frequent crowd control measures.\"]}",
     "The modernisation and extension of the station would support the vibrant local economy and community, and reduce walking time between the station and the popular Camden Lock area. The existing station entrance would remain in use, and no changes would be made to nearby buildings, helping to sustain Camden's unique character.",
     "Gareth Powell, London Underground's Director for Strategy, said:",
     "'Camden Town is already one of our busiest interchange stations, and customer numbers are set to rise rapidly as London's population grows.",
     "'Our plans to modernise and expand the station would mean a new entrance, step-free access, and much better journeys for customers. We're keen to hear as many views on our plans as possible, so that we deliver the improvements that people want to see.'",
     "LU is working closely with Camden Council on all proposals and, subject to funding and the relevant permissions, work on the station project could begin in 2019, for completion in 2023/4.",
     "The public consultation will run from Monday 12 October until 11 December 2015. Please visit \u003ca href=\"http://tfl.gov.uk/camden-town-upgrade\"\u003etfl.gov.uk/camden-town-upgrade\u003c/a\u003e to tell TfL what you think.",

Continued investment is essential so that as London grows, everyone who lives, works and visits, has the transport they need.\",\"TfL worked with AHR Architects (London Office), led by Projects Director Adam Firth, to produce the materials for this consultation.\"]}"
