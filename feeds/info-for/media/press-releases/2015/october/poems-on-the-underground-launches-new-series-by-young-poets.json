     "A new selection of Poems on the Underground has been launched today, featuring works by young poets. The new series - chosen in partnership with the Poetry Society - explores young people's contemporary lives and draws from a range of themes, from play time to public transport.",
     "The 'Young Poets on the Underground' are Laura Harray (15), Imogen Cassels (19) and Matt Broomfield (21). The poems will be visible on Tube trains across the network for four weeks.",
     "Judith Chernaik, writer, editor and founder of Poems on the Underground, said: `We're delighted to welcome the work of these young poets to the Tube. This set of poems is testament to the creative imagination of young people across the country, and we hope that the four million daily Tube passengers will agree.'",
     "Poems on the Underground, founded in 1986, aims to bring poetry to a mass audience. It helps to make journeys more stimulating and inspiring by showcasing a diverse range of poetry, including classical, contemporary and international poets in Tube train carriages across London. Poems on the Underground is supported by Transport for London, Arts Council England and the British Council.",
