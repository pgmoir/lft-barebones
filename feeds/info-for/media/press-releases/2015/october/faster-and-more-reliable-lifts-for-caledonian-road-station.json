     "Vital work to modernise the two lifts at Caledonian Road Tube station will begin on Monday 4 January.",
     "The nature of the work means that while this essential upgrade is carried out, the station will be closed until mid-August 2016.  During this time customers who usually use Caledonian Road Tube station are advised to use nearby Holloway Road Tube station and Caledonian Road \u0026 Barnsbury Overground station.",
     "Gareth Powell, Director of Strategy for London Underground, said: `We're sorry for the disruption that this work will cause customers.  Customer safety is our number one priority, which means we have to close the station to replace the lifts in the safest way.  This decision has not been taken lightly and we will work really hard to complete this vital work as quickly as possible",
     "`When the works are complete everyone will benefit from a new, more reliable service.'",
     "During the period when the station is closed, customers are advised to use Holloway Road Tube station or Caledonian Road \u0026 Barnsbury Overground station. From Caledonian Road Underground station, Holloway Underground station is a 9-13 minute walk or a short bus journey away.",
     "Caledonian Road \u0026 Barnsbury Overground station is a 5 -10 minute walk or a short bus journey away, served by London bus routes 91 or 259. Alternatively passengers can travel on to King's Cross St. Pancras on bus routes 91 or 259, which takes around 20 minutes.",
     "The current lifts are around 30-years old and need to be refurbished to ensure they work reliably - the existing lifts fail once a week on average, causing disruption to customers.",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Lift refurbishment in Tube stations is a lengthy process, with the removal and replacement of hundreds of mechanical and electrical parts taking place in a cramped working space. Because of this, replacing lifts at a station like Caledonian Road - with a single lift shaft that continues deep underground - takes some months\",\"TfL is delivering one of the world's largest programmes of capital investment, which includes building Crossrail, modernising Tube services and stations, improving the road network and making roads safer for cyclists and pedestrians. Continued investment is essential so that as our city grows, everyone who lives, works and visits, has the transport they need\",\"LU is undertaking a major programme of renewal which will inevitably result in some disruption for customers, but TfL is working hard to provide information and alternative travel options.  The work is essential to provide for London's growing transport needs now, and into the future\",\"Information including a video on how we replace lifts on our network can be found here: \\u003ca href=\\\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/campaign/tube-improvements/behind-the-scenes/escalator-refurbishment?intcmp=14562\\\"\\u003ehttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/campaign/tube-improvements/behind-the-scenes/escalator-refurbishment?intcmp=14562\\u003c/a\\u003e \",\"TfL is advising all Londoners and Tube, London Overground, London Tramlink and DLR customers to \\\"check before you travel\\\" at weekends, allowing extra journey time where necessary.
