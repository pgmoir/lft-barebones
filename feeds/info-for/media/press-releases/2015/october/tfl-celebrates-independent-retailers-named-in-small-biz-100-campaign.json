     "TfL is a substantial retail landlord in the Capital, with the vast majority of retailers across its network being independent companies.",
     "Graeme Craig, Director of Commercial Development at TfL, said: '95% of our retailers are independent businesses. We are committed to working with businesses to help them succeed and ensure we provide the variety of services our customers want and need.",
     "'It is fantastic that three retailers on our network have made it onto the 'Small Biz 100'. December 5 marks Small Business Saturday and we want to encourage our customers to visit their local independent businesses and see the range of things on offer.'",
     "Michelle Ovens, National Campaign Director of Small Business Saturday UK, said: 'Although the campaign focuses on one day, the goal is to have a lasting impact on small businesses by changing mind-sets, so that people make it their mission to support small businesses all year round.",
     "'Most people in this country own a small business, work for a small business or know somebody who does, so supporting a small business on Small Business Saturday is absolutely personal.'",
     "Small Business Saturday is the UK's most successful small business campaign. Last year 16.5 million people went out to support a small business on Small Business Saturday with 64% of the UK aware of the campaign. The UK's small businesses between them provide 60% of private sector jobs and nearly 50% of private sector turnover. Last year the campaign trended at number one on Twitter on the day and received around 3.5 million views on its Facebook page. This year Small Business Saturday carries the theme '5 million small businesses, 1 big day'.",

People see the journey to wellness as an unpleasant one, we set out to prove that healthy juices and nutritious food can be fast, cheap and delicious. Being a small business owner means hard work and waking up every day knowing that you're doing something for you, not because you're told to.'\",\"Founder of Etna Coffee, Gaetano Bauso, said: 'We want to give Londoners a taste of the real Sicily, a land rich in history, flavours, fragrances and traditions. On the 5th December we plan to offer all our customers a discount to celebrate and promote Small Business Saturday.'\",\"Founder of Turning Earth Ceramics, Tallie Maughan, said: 'Our users range from the beginners who attend our classes through to serious hobbyists and early-career potters who want to make a living in this sector. Through efficient use of resources we provide access to facilities including wheels and kilns, expertise from experienced artists, and lots of workspace, all for the affordable price of £155 a month. Users can come and go as they please so it's like having access to their own studio, with a lot more support and at a fraction of the cost.'\"]}"
