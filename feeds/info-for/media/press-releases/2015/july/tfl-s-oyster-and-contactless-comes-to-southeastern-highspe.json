     "Transport for London's (TfL's) contactless revolution continues today as Southeastern's highspeed service becomes the latest to accept the new convenient way to pay for travel.",
     "Customers will now be able to use contactless and Oyster pay as you go between St Pancras International and Stratford International. The development will make many journeys between north and east London quicker and more convenient, and is the latest example of the expansion of contactless and Oyster to make customers' journeys easier. TfL developed the contactless technology needed to travel on its services in-house and is leading the way with over 130 million contactless journeys made on services since it launched in September 2014.",
     "Some 20 per cent of pay as you go journeys are now made using contactless, and in March this year TfL was named the fastest growing contactless Visa merchant in Europe and in the UK for MasterCard and American Express. This was only six months after the launch of contactless on Tube, tram, DLR, London Overground, and most National Rail services in London. Contactless was first accepted on London Buses in December 2012.",
     "The introduction of contactless and Oyster between St Pancras and Stratford International comes in time for the Rugby World Cup matches at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford and removes the need for customers to buy a ticket to travel. It will also make life easier for people visiting the shops in Stratford or attending the various events that take place in the area.",
     "TfL Director of Customer Experience, Shashi Verma, said: `This is just one of the many contactless and Oyster projects we are working on with the goal of making paying for transport easier for everyone travelling in the Capital and beyond. Over 20 per cent of our pay as you go customers are using contactless already, because it is a more convenient option. Oyster will always be available too, but I would encourage anyone who uses pay as you go to try contactless. There's no need to top-up - you just touch in and out with your credit or debit card.'",
     "Southeastern's Head of Customer Service, Alison Nolan, said: `This is great news for customers who make this journey as they will now be able to do so while taking in the experience of our flagship highspeed service.'",
