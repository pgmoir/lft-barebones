     "Transport for London (TfL) customers beat the Tube strike this morning with help from transport workers across the bus network, DLR, London Overground, TfL Rail, Trams, river services, Emirates Air Line and Santander Cycles. No Tube services are running today as a result of union strike action. Tube services will resume tomorrow with a full service, but customers are advised to check before they travel.",
     "As expected, bus services were very busy this morning, particularly around mainline rail stations, but the bus network performed well. Extra bus and river services ran to help people get around. Commuters took advantage of the good weather, taking to Santander Cycles in around double their usual numbers and walking part or all of their journey to work. Some parts of the rail network were much busier than usual. On the roads there was heavy traffic, with high levels of demand beginning earlier than normal on the main routes into London.",
     "This evening TfL expect buses, DLR, London Overground, TfL Rail, Trams, river services, Emirates Air Line, Santander Cycles and main roads to all be busy again as people head home. The evening peak is likely to start earlier than usual as customers travel home at different times to normal. National rail services will run as normal, and are likely to be busier than usual.",
     "LU has tried everything possible to engage the unions over the last five months to try to reach an agreement on pay and the introduction of the Night Tube 24-hour Underground services at weekends from September.

     "'We thank Londoners for their patience today as we work hard to help them make their journeys. It's been very busy today, particularly on the bus and road networks, although many people are travelling outside peak hours and walking and cycling. Our staff are working hard to help by providing maps, travel advice and other information.",
     "'We are, as we always have been, ready to talk at any time to sort out this dispute. We have made a very fair and reasonable offer to our staff, but the unions have so far refused to respond or put it to their members. The offer remains on the table and we are ready for talks. We have today contacted ACAS and asked them to assist us in getting back around the table. If the unions are serious about resolving this, we trust they will be ready to engage in meaningful talks to deliver Night Tube for London.'",
