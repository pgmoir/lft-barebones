     "This summer, Transport for London (TfL), London Transport Museum and their partners are launching an 18-month programme of events, exhibitions and competitions to celebrate the role of good transport design in the Capital over the last 150 years.",
     "`Transported by Design' will celebrate the design legacy of London's transport, showcase the innovative ways good design is used on today's transport network and will look forward to the designs that will help shape London's future.",
     "'Design Icons', which kicks off in August, will be the first in the series of events and consists of a search for London's most iconic transport designs or designers as voted for by the public. Good design can be experienced right across the transport network - from the world-famous Tube map originally designed by Harry Beck, to the iconic Roundel logo, the classic Routemaster and new Routemaster buses and black taxis, and the extraordinary architecture across the road and rail networks. People will be able to vote for their favourite design icons until October.",
     "Mike Brown MVO, London's Transport Commissioner,  said: `Our purpose is to keep London working and growing and to make life here better.  Good design in transport is central to the delivery of that, as it has been for over 150 years.  This ranges from vehicles, stations, signs and maps to the Oyster card, our website and open data feeds.  With London's population growing from 8.6 million now to 10 million by 2030, we will use Transported by Design to make sure that we continue to help customers and all Londoners make their journeys as seamlessly as possible through innovative and thoughtful 21st century design.'",
     "Other highlights of 'Transported by Design' programme will include:",

     "Sam Mullins, Director London Transport Museum, said: `We are delighted to be working with TfL to celebrate the powerful legacy and exciting vision of London's design heritage. Our 'London by Design' season will showcase the evolution of many of the Capital's design classics as well as look at contemporary and future innovation.  By focusing on a wide spectrum including posters and graphics, the iconic Tube map and world famous roundel, to pioneering vehicle design and architectural innovation, the season will explore how design continues to shape London.'",
     "As part of 'Transported by Design,' London Underground is introducing a new design standard across all Underground stations.  From October 2015, the London Underground Design Idiom will set out a number of design principles that will be applied to every style of station project, from small-scale repairs to major refurbishments. This will ensure stations are built and developed with uniformly high standards of design, which retain and celebrate individuality and local character while forming part of a cohesive network.",
