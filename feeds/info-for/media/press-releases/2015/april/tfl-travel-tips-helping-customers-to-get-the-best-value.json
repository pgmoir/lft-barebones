     "A new campaign to help customers get the most out of travelling in London has been launched by Transport for London (TfL). New poster and digital adverts are on display across the transport network to promote travel tips including the different payment options available; how to get the best value fare; the benefits of having an online account; and how to get a refund.",

     "Go contactless, go anywhere, and never top up again",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Contactless payment cards are debit, credit, charge or pre-paid cards which can be used to make quick, easy and secure payments for everyday purchases including travel in London. Using contactless saves time as there is no need to top up, there is no need for a PIN or a signature either. To travel, customers just touch their card in on a yellow card reader at the start of their journey and out at the end.\",\"Pay as you go fares on contactless and Oyster are the same. Using pay as you go is cheaper than buying a paper ticket.\",\"Whether a customer uses a contactless or Oyster card, both offer daily capping that limits the amount they will pay for travel that day. When the total cost of all journeys made reaches a certain amount, a cap is applied and journeys made for the rest of the day in the same zones will not be charged.\"]}",

Customers can top up their Oyster credit at nearly 4,000 Oyster Ticket Stops in newsagents and shops across London.\"]}",

     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"A Visitor Oyster card is a quick, cheap and easy way to pay for travel on public transport around London - customers can buy the card online and get it posted to their home address so they have it before they come to London. They can also save money with special offers and discounts on things to do in London. For more information and to buy a Visitor Oyster card go to: \\u003ca href=\\\"http://visitorshop.tfl.gov.uk/\\\"\\u003ehttp://visitorshop.tfl.gov.uk/\\u003c/a\\u003e \"]}",

Pink card readers at some Tube, London Overground and National Rail stations tell TfL which route a customer has taken so the correct fare is charged. Customers can find out if their journey has a cheaper fare which avoids Zone 1 by using the single fare finder at \\u003ca href=\\\"http://tfl.gov.uk/farefinder\\\"\\u003etfl.gov.uk/farefinder\\u003c/a\\u003e \"]}",

Customers can choose to get email updates about planned disruptions on their regular route if they have an online account and they can also apply for refunds for incomplete journeys.\"]}",
     "Contactless online account",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Although customers do not need to sign up for an online account to use their contactless card to travel, if they do, they will benefit from a summary of the cost of travel, journey and payment history, and email alerts if there's an issue with the contactless card, which could stop them from using it to travel.
