     "Transport for London's (TfL's) newly published spring and summer guide to London's river services gives all the information needed to plan a leisurely trip on the river or to make changes to customer's commutes.",
     "The guide, available at selected piers and London Underground stations and in both audio and large print formats, contains timetable information for all River Bus services and also for River Tours services. The guide also offers a range of leisure activities such as sightseeing cruises, dinner cruises and more exhilarating trips on RIB boats.",
     "For anyone with a big event coming up this summer, the Thames is a great venue for any celebration.  There are a number of charter boat operators offering a variety of vessels of different sizes to suit any party.",
     "Andy Thompson, Head of London River Services, said:",
     "'The Thames is at the centre of London, and river services offer a great opportunity to see the city in a different way.  Last year more people than ever enjoyed time on the Thames, with 9.8 million passengers taking to the river.  With work continuing to improve river services and events like Totally Thames taking place again in September, it promises to be an exciting summer ahead on the river.'",
     "Notes to Editors:",
