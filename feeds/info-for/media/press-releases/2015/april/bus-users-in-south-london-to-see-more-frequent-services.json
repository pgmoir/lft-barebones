     "Local bus services in south London are to get a further boost from this Saturday (2 May), as Transport for London (TfL) increases the frequency of the 322 and the G1, to provide extra capacity on these busy routes.  The G1 is currently operated by Go-Ahead, the 322 will change operator to Go-Ahead on Saturday.",
     "Route 322, which operates between Crystal Palace and Clapham Common via Gypsy Hill, Tulse Hill, Herne Hill, Brixton and Clapham North will see its frequency increased from every 15 minutes to every 12 minutes during the daytime on Mondays to Saturdays.  This represents a 25 per cent increase in capacity.  During Sunday shopping hours the service will also be increased from a bus every 20 minutes to one every 15 minutes.",
     "Route G1, which operates between Streatham High Road (Green Lane) and Battersea (Shaftesbury Estate) via Streatham, Tooting Broadway, Wandsworth Common, Clapham South and Clapham Common will see its frequency increased from a bus every 20 minutes to one every 15 minutes during the daytime on Mondays to Saturdays.  This represents a 33 per cent increase in capacity.  During Sunday shopping hours the service will also be increased from a bus every 30 minutes to one every 20 minutes, together with earlier journeys in the morning.",
     "This change has been introduced to respond to increasing demand on this route.",
     "John Barry, Head of Network Development for TfL, said: 'London has an extensive bus network which is kept under regular review in order to give our passengers the best possible service.  We are pleased to be able to introduce improved services on routes 322 and G1 - a great example of this policy in action.'"
