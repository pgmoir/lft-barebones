     "Transport for London (TfL) has today given planners access to better public transport information and new tools via its website to assist them with the development of future neighbourhoods and communities.",
     "Public Transport Access Levels (PTAL) information is now available in a clearer and more visual format using the latest interactive map technology.  This information provides a rating of how well connected areas are to the public transport network, which is especially important during the planning process.  PTALs are used by councils to make planning decisions, and also by businesses and service providers when considering where to locate new services.",
     "Richard de Cani, TfL's Managing Director of Planning, said: `With London's population set to grow from 8.6m today to around 10m by 2030, planners have a crucial role in shaping what neighbourhoods and communities will look like in the future. By providing them with access to better information and new tools we will be able to ensure that public transport is firmly part of their designs which will affect how people live and work in the Capital.'",
     "To complement the PTAL information, a new time mapping feature called TIM enables planners to map expected travel times from any point in London.",
     "It will also mean planners can consider the transport impact of future plans, as both PTAL and TIM information will be available for a \"future scenario\" that considers  transport improvements such as Crossrail.",
     "TfL is already working on further information that will be made publicly available which will allow planners to easily plot the number of workplaces and residents that can be reached within a defined area from every location in London.",
