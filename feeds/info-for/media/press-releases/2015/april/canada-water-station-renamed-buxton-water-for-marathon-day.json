     "Transport for London (TfL) has signed a landmark sponsorship deal which will see Canada Water London Underground (LU) station renamed Buxton Water station for one day, on Sunday 26 April 2015, the day of the 35th Virgin Money London Marathon.",
     "Canada Water roundels will be replaced by 'Buxton Water' and branded artwork will be placed all over the station to celebrate runners taking part in London's largest annual running event. The artwork will carry the hashtag #withyoualltheway to mark Buxton Water's role as the official water provider of the Virgin Money London Marathon.  The main station entrance sign will remain unchanged.",
     "The revenue TfL will receive from the deal is part of its wider commercial plans to generate £3.4bn in non-fare revenue over the next decade, which will be reinvested in to improving London's public transport and road network for the benefit of customers and users.",
     "The partnership combines two famous brands to celebrate one of the largest and most prestigious marathon races in the world and has been designed to enhance the experience of customers using the station on the day, whilst raising awareness of drinking enough water on the go.",
     "Graeme Craig, Director of Commercial Development at TfL, said: `For one day only, customers will see Canada Water station transformed into Buxton Water station as part of their support of the Virgin Money London Marathon. This is a significant deal and the revenue will be reinvested back into our network for the benefit of our customers.'",
     "Buxton Water has been the Official Water provider of the Virgin Money London Marathon for two years and will be with the runners all the way by providing water at every mile from mile three through to mile 25.",
     "Caroline Juin, Head of Marketing at Nestlé Waters UK, commented: `We are really excited to be a part of this ground breaking sponsorship. Renaming a London Underground station Buxton Water on the day of the marathon not only showcases our commitment to the event but raises awareness of the importance of drinking enough water, whether it be on your daily commute or running a marathon.'",
     "Hugh Brasher, Race Director at the Virgin Money London Marathon, commented: `The group company Nestlé Water have been great supporters of the Virgin Money London Marathon for many years and Buxton Water have been our water partner for the last two years. Their partnership with TfL to create the Buxton Water station is a great example of how sponsors of the marathon are engaging with not only the runners but also the estimated ¾ million spectators that line the course'",
     "Station announcements, as well as information across the digital screens and Dot Matrix Indicators on the Jubilee line platforms, will advise customers that the name change is part of a one day sponsorship deal.",
     "Customers travelling to and from the Virgin Money London Marathon are advised to plan their journey in advance using TfL's dedicated webpage \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/marathon\"\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk/marathon\u003c/a\u003e .",
