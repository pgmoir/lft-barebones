     "The Estée Lauder Companies UK \u0026 Ireland has become the latest company to join Transport for London's (TfL) retail revolution by signing a year long contract for a pop-up retail unit at Piccadilly Circus London Underground Station.",
     "The deal is part of TfL's plans to transform the retail facilities available for customers, giving them the services they want as they travel around the transport network. It is also part of TfL's wider commercial plans to maximise its assets in order to generate £3.4bn in non-fare revenue over the next decade which it will reinvest back into the network to deliver improved transport services for customers.",
     "On Friday 15 May, botanical hair, skincare and make-up brand, Aveda, became the first from the Companies' portfolio of brands to occupy one of the retail units at the iconic station, which opened in March 1906. Aveda will join four other retailers at the station, ranging from a pop-up doughnut shop to a long-standing watch repairer.  Over the last four months, TfL has worked to reinstate the original showcase cabinets at the station, which The Estée Lauder Companies will also use to display their brands to the 40 million customers who use the station each year.",
     "Stuart Anderson, Head of Retail at TfL, said: `We are absolutely delighted to have The Estée Lauder Companies on board as we continue to improve the services on offer for our customers as they use the transport network. Their brand is a brilliant addition to the retail mix available at Piccadilly Circus Tube station and they will sit alongside our long-standing tenants.",
     "`The move is part of our ongoing plans to improve the retail shops available to customers whilst generating long-term revenue to reinvest back into our network.'",
     "Jo Dancey, Executive Director of Retail Operations and Property Services for The Estée Lauder Companies UK \u0026 Ireland, said: `As a consumer-inspired company we wanted to create an offering that would speak to our consumers' needs for a retail experience that fits around their busy lifestyles. By bringing The Estée Lauder Companies' wide offering of premium brands to Piccadilly Circus we are able to extend our high-touch service to reach consumers in a new and unexpected format.'",
     "Annie Walker, Director of the Regent Street Association, said: 'Piccadilly Circus Tube station is at the heart of Regent Street and we're delighted TfL is continuing its drive to bring new retailers to the area alongside existing tenants to provide a great variety of services to customers.'",
     "TfL is also working with small businesses, independent retailers and start-up companies who are operating at stations across the transport network.",
