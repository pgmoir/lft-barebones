     "LU is advising customers who use Bank and Monument Underground stations that planned escalator maintenance work will begin on Sunday 24 May, and will be completed in just under two weeks on Sunday 7 June.",
     "The planned maintenance work has been scheduled to take place at quieter periods to minimise disruption to customers.  Once the work has been completed customers will benefit from a more reliable escalator service in coming years as the Tube carries ever more passengers.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Tube investment programme\"}",
     "The escalator maintenance is part of the continuing Tube investment programme with major stations, trains, track and signalling being modernised or replaced to provide more capacity for a growing city.",
     "Escalators on the Underground are longer and more heavy duty than most. They carry huge volumes of people and run for approximately 20 hours a day.",
     "While both escalators are being upgraded the walking route from the District and Circle lines at Monument Tube station to the Central, Northern and Waterloo \u0026 City lines at Bank Tube station will be at street level.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Vital\"}",
     "There will be signage to direct customers out of the ticket hall at Monument station and along King William Street to the entrance to Bank station.  The walking route towards the District and Circle line platforms from Bank is not affected.",
     "Chris Taggart, London Underground's General Manager for the Central line, said: 'The planned escalator maintenance work due to take place at Bank station is vital to ensure their continued reliable operation for our customers as the number of people using the station continues to increase.",
     "'I apologise for the disruption to customers using the station and we have plans in place to help people complete their journeys with as little impact as possible.'",
