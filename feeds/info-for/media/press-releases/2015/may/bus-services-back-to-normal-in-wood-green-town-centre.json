     "Bus passengers travelling through the Wood Green area will see their bus services return to normal on Saturday 30 May following the completion of Haringey Council work in Wood Green Town Centre.",
     "Transport for London's (TfL) Head of Network Development John Barry, said: `I would like to thank our passengers for their patience and understanding during the work which required bus services to be diverted.",
     "`Our buses will now be able to run through the town centre without disruption and passengers will have a much better journey due to this improvement project which was carried out by the council with TfL funding.'",
     "The services which were either diverted, terminated early or curtailed during the work which began in September 2014 and which will now return to the routes previously in place, are, 121, 144, 221, 230, 232, 329 and W4.",
     "Haringey Council has invested Â£4.2m in Wood Green Town Centre to de-clutter pavements and open spaces from Wood Green to Turnpike Lane Tube Stations and make the High Road a more welcoming place for residents.",
     "Highlights of the scheme include:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Wider pavements; new, more sensible pedestrian crossings, and raised road surfaces to cut driving speeds and prioritise shoppers and visitors at junctions\",\"New bus shelters along the High Road, with stopping points moved to more accessible places and 'Legible London' signage installed to help visitors find their way around\",\"More trees and plants to spruce up public spaces, alongside new 'green walls'\",\"Better cycling facilities, with more bike stands and a review of all current cycle routes\",\"Improved street lighting, picturesque lights in trees and lighting of alleyways and dark spots to improve safety\"]}"
