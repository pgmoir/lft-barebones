Hillingdon Council have installed a bench at the stop to make any wait more comfortable and the stop can also be used by local community transport operators.",
     "Paul Blackwell, General Manager of Dial-a-Ride at TfL, said:",
     "'We are very pleased to have worked with Hillingdon Council to install a dedicated stop for Dial-a-Ride passengers in Uxbridge town centre. It's the third dedicated Dial-a-Ride stop in the Capital and will give those with mobility issues convenient access to the shops, health centre and other amenities and reassure them that they are waiting in the right location.'",

     "'TfL's Dial-a-Ride service is a lifeline for Hillingdon residents with mobility issues as it helps them to remain independent.  We welcome the new dedicated stop in Uxbridge, which is in a convenient and safe location and clearly signposted.  The council's addition of a bench will also make waiting for transport to arrive much easier.'",
