     "London Underground (LU) today advised customers to 'Check Before You Travel' should strike action threatened by the leadership of the RMT go ahead on the evening of Saturday 7 March. The strike action has been called by the RMT leadership after one of its members, a Tube driver, was dismissed by LU after failing two alcohol breath tests.",

     "Safety for customers using the network is LU's number one priority, which is why a zero tolerance policy towards alcohol at work is strictly adhered to. Anyone found to be in breach of this policy faces a disciplinary process and possible dismissal. LU's health and safety procedures are fully in line with medical standards and represent best practice in the rail industry.",
     "The RMT driver strike action is currently due to take place from 21:30 on Saturday 7 March until 03:59 on Sunday 8 March.  If it does go ahead LU intends to run a good service on all lines but there is a small chance of some disruption on some lines. The DLR, London Overground and National Rail will not be affected.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Indefensible strike\"}",
     "Nick Brown, London Underground's Chief Operating Officer, said: 'This indefensible strike is about one RMT driver dismissed for failing two alcohol breath tests. We will not be swayed by it as we will never compromise on the safety of our customers and staff.  You wouldn't let someone who had been drinking alcohol drive your family in a car, and we don't let people who have been drinking alcohol drive people's families in Tube trains.",
     "'Less than a quarter of the RMT members eligible to vote for strike action did so. For the RMT leadership to announce a strike regardless shows how completely out of touch they are, just as the timing demonstrates that they know they have very little support from their members on this issue.",
     "'Should they go through with this action it will achieve nothing and we'll work to ensure Londoners are kept informed and can still get around.'",
     "Customers are advised to check the TfL website for the latest Tube service levels and to follow @TfLTravelAlerts on Twitter."
