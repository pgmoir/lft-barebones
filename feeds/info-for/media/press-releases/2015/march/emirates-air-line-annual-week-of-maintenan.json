     "The Emirates Air Line will close for its annual planned maintenance work for one week from Monday 16 to Sunday 22 March 2015.",
     "The work that will be carried out is a statutory requirement in line with annual essential maintenance programmes that take place on cable cars around the world and will be completed by Mace.",
     "The nature of the work means that to deliver this safely it needs to be carried out in daylight hours. It will include electrical testing, comprehensive weight testing for each of the 36 cabins and a full inspection of the sheave wheels that the cable passes through at the top of the three helix towers.",
     "TfL's Head of the Emirates Air Line, Danny Price, said:",
     "'Since opening nearly three years ago passenger numbers on the Emirates Air Line continue to grow and there has been consistently high levels of customer satisfaction. We apologise for any disruption the maintenance closure causes passengers. By carrying out all of this vital work now we will not require any further planned closures this year.'",
     "While the closure is in place, the nearest alternative public transport is North Greenwich Tube station on the south side of the Emirates Air Line served by the Jubilee line and Royal Victoria DLR station on the north side of the scheme. Both are a short walk away from the Emirates Air Line. Bus services are available from North Greenwich bus station and Royal Victoria. River services also operate from North Greenwich Pier next to the Emirates Greenwich Peninsula terminal.",
     "Since opening, customer feedback has been consistently high with the Emirates Air Line receiving average scores of 93 out of 100, for both overall satisfaction and likelihood to recommend the service to others. The Emirates Air Line continues to cover its operating costs and support regeneration in the area.",
     "For information about local public transport and to plan your journey, please visit \u003ca href=\"http://tfl.gov.uk/journeyplanner\"\u003ehttp://tfl.gov.uk/journeyplanner\u003c/a\u003e "
