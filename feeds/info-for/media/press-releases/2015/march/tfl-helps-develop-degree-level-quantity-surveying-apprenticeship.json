     "Transport for London (TfL) has received ministerial approval to develop innovative new Chartered Surveying Apprentice Standards, as part of a consortium of employers with professional surveying backgrounds.",
     "Following a review of apprenticeships carried out by Doug Richard, the government announced the apprenticeship reforms under Trailblazers. As a result of these reforms, employers were asked to lead on developing the new standards for apprenticeships in their sector/industries.",
     "TfL were approached by the Chartered Surveyors Training Trust (CSTT) to work alongside other employers and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) to design new standards in the field of surveying at level 3 and level 6.",
     "These pioneering new standards will enable apprentices to achieve a degree level qualification (level 6), enabling TfL to further develop its current Quantity Surveying Apprentices to provide an alternative entry route into the profession.  For young people looking to start their career, this provides the choice to follow a work based vocational route via structured learning leading to a degree level qualification.",
     "These employer designed apprenticeships will assist TfL in preparing London's transport infrastructure for the future. With London's population set to grow from 8.6 million today to 10 million by 2030, apprentices will work on one of the biggest programmes of transport investment in the world. They will also provide day-to-day support to customers and road users who make around 30 million journeys every day on TfL's public transport and road networks.",
     "Skills Minister Nick Boles said: `Degree apprenticeships are opening the door to professions such as surveying for many more young people across the country. They also play a key role in developing the high level technical skills British employers need to compete on the world stage. Apprenticeships provide life changing opportunities and I would like to thank Transport for London for their hard work and commitment to this important initiative.'",
     "Business Secretary Vince Cable said: `The apprentice agenda is not simply a numbers game, it is about quality as much as quantity. Degree apprenticeships bring together the very best of higher and vocational education, and allow apprentices to achieve a full bachelor's or master's degree, whilst training on the job. The initiative sees employers such as Transport for London, universities, and professional bodies joining forces to develop the highly skilled workers our economy needs.'",
     "Rachel McCarthy, a Junior Quantity Surveyor at TfL, said: `I joined the TfL Quantity Surveyor apprenticeship scheme back in 2011 and I've never looked back. Over the last few years, I've worked on some amazing projects such as installing new CCTV cameras in train carriages. The support I received from my apprenticeship was exceptional and throughout the scheme, I was also able to gain the relevant qualifications and I am now a Junior Quantity Surveyor, working on the London Underground lines upgrade. Apprenticeships offer real career prospects and I would definitely recommend doing one.'",
     "The total number of apprenticeship roles created by TfL and its supply chain is almost 5,500, supporting the Mayor of London's campaign to create more apprenticeships for Londoners. Nearly 190,000 apprentices have begun work in London since 2010 and over 40,000 people now start an apprenticeship every year in London, which is more than double the number starting four years ago. Those vastly improved results are thanks to a massive amount of work and investment that the Mayor is coordinating alongside the national apprenticeships service and employers.",
