     "Transport for London (TfL) has teamed up with broadcaster ITV to bring London commuters live news and updates from the Rugby World Cup 2015 as part of a commercial partnership that will generate revenue to reinvest in the transport network.",
     "The partnership will ensure that customers will not miss out on the action as live news, results and score updates will be streamed across the Tube and DLR networks over the full six weeks of the competition. The information will be available on the digital information boards at the entrances of all stations and on platforms at over 180 London Underground and DLR stations.",
     "The new service was unveiled today at Southwark Tube station by Women's Rugby World Cup 2014 winner Maggie Alphonsi. Countdown messages will run leading up to the inaugural match between England and Fiji on Friday 18 September, after which live updates will be provided.",
     "The partnership is part of TfL's wider plans to generate £3.4bn in non-fare revenue by 2020/21 to reinvest in the running and vital modernisation of the transport network.",
     "Graeme Craig, Director of Commercial Development at TfL, said:",
     "'We're delighted to team up with ITV to bring the live news and updates from 2015 Rugby World Cup to our customers. This partnership, which taps in to the growing excitement around the tournament, is a great demonstration of how we generate commercial revenue to reinvest in London's transport network.'",
     "ITV is the exclusive television broadcaster of the Rugby World Cup 2015, and Maggie Alphonsi MBE, a stand-out member of England's Women's Rugby World Cup 2014 winning side, will be part of their broadcasting line up.",
     "A Londoner herself, Alphonsi said:",
     "'The match scheduling means that there will be plenty of commuters travelling on the London Underground at crucial moments throughout the Tournament, who might otherwise miss out on the action. This is a brilliant way to keep fans up to date during the big games, when they are not able to watch them live on ITV or ITV Player.'",
     "ITV's Director of Sport, Niall Sloane, said:",
     "'This partnership with TfL cements ITV's commitment to rugby, delivering content to fans no matter where they are. Bringing Rugby World Cup scores and news to London Underground's passenger information services provides us with a unique platform to deliver our fan-centric approach to the sport and providing the best possible coverage of the Tournament.'",
     "ITV will provide live and exclusive coverage of every single match throughout the six weeks of the Tournament, hosted by England, from the opening fixture on 18 September, through to the final on 31 October.",
     "Notes to Editors:",
