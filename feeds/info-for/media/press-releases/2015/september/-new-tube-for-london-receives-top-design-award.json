     "London Underground and design partner PriestmanGoode were unveiled as the Silver Top Winners at the Industrial Designers Society of America's (IDSA's) International Design Excellence Awards.",
     "The award was presented for the New Tube for London train design in the Top Winner Automotive \u0026 Transportation category.",
     "The New Tube is the next generation of Underground train, which will come in to service in London from the mid-2020s. It will be introduced first on the Piccadilly line, followed by the Bakerloo, Central, and Waterloo \u0026 City lines. Its innovative design will allow for air-cooling for the first time on deep-level sections of the Tube. The train also features improved accessibility - with level access to platforms - as well as walk-through carriages and wider doors.",
     "Gareth Powell, London Underground's Director of Strategy, said: `Over 1,700 projects from around the world entered this prestigious competition so we are delighted that the New Tube for London has been given international recognition for its innovative design. Our vision is for a train that both echoes the best of London's design heritage and utilises the latest modern technology. I am proud of the joint accomplishments of the New Tube for London team, the wider London Underground design team and PriestmanGoode, and of the recognition this award brings.'",
     "Paul Priestman, Director, PriestmanGoode, said: `I'm delighted that a piece of public transport is receiving recognition in this well respected competition. Designing in the public transportation space is challenging in many aspects; in short, heavy traffic in a constrained space requiring an industrially robust environment. This is a challenge where design is able to show its real value, delivering an improved experience and environment for the passenger.'",
     "The win comes as Transport for London (TfL) launches Transported by Design - a programme of events, exhibitions and competitions celebrating the role of good design on London's transport network.",
     "Kicking off the campaign is Design Icons, the search to find London's favourite transport design. There is a shortlist of 100 items including the black cab and the Roundel.  Voting closes on 1 October 2015, after which time the most popular designs will be showcased in a special event in the New Year and then displayed across the transport network.",
