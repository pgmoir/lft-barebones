     "There is just one month left to vote for your favourite London transport design.",
     "Voting for London's transport Design Icons closes on 1 October, with the 50 most popular designs to be announced in December before being showcased across the transport network in the New Year.",
     "Transport for London (TfL) and London Transport Museum's (LTM), Design Icons search is part of `Transported by Design', an 18-month programme of events, exhibitions and competitions which celebrate the role of good design on the Capital's transport network.",
     "The world-famous black cab, original Tube map and iconic Roundel are currently leading the race. Other items in the 100-strong shortlist include; Covent Garden station's exterior, Cycle Hire bikes, the Gibson ticket machine and Wapping Tunnel.",
     "The full shortlist of 100 items, carefully chosen by industry experts, TfL and London Transport Museum staff are grouped into categories:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Above Ground\",\"Below Ground\",\"Heritage\",\"Innovation\",\"Hidden Design\",\"Other\"]}",
     "The most popular transport designs are currently:",
     "Mike Brown MVO, London's Transport Commissioner, said: `It has been fantastic to see so many Londoners vote already for their favourite transport design and we can't wait to discover the final top 10 next month. Through our Design Icons search we want to showcase how, from the smallest detail of the new Routemaster to the multi-billion pound upgrade projects, everything we design is with people in mind.'",
     "Sam Mullins, Director of London Transport Museum, said: `As custodians of London's travel heritage, it has never been more relevant to draw attention to one of London's greatest triumphs: its transport designs. By asking the public to select their favourite London transport design, we aim to highlight how design continues to shape the Capital.'",
     "Speaking about his Design Icon, the Roundel, Wayne Hemmingway MBE, said: `It is a testament to the powerfully simple, eminently British and timeless design, along with the love of what the London Underground does for the city, that the Roundel is an icon.'",
