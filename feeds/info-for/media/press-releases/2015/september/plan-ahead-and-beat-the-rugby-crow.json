     "With the Cherry Blossoms upsetting the Boks on Saturday, Rugby World Cup 2015 has already provided some real shocks. However, customers using the Capital's transport network can avoid their own surprises by heeding Transport for London's (TfL's) travel advice and planning ahead as tens of thousands of rugby fans descend on east London.",
     "Tonight (Wednesday 23 September) France play Romania, while tomorrow (Thursday 24 September) New Zealand face Namibia - both at The Stadium, Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Tube and rail services to and from Stratford are expected to be busy from 17:00 until 19:30 and from 21:40 until midnight on both days. London is hosting a number of other events this week including One Direction at The O2 Arena on Thursday, so TfL is advising customers to plan ahead, allow more time and if possible re-time or seek alternative routes for their journeys. Rugby fans are advised to get to Stratford early and use less crowded alternatives as the station is served by numerous rail lines.",
     "While most transport services across London will be unaffected and operating as normal, public transport and roads serving the stadiums will be much busier before and after the matches. Customers and road users not attending the matches are advised to, where possible, avoid these venues when games are taking place and plan their journeys at \u003ca href=\"http://tfl.gov.uk/rugby-travel\"\u003etfl.gov.uk/rugby-travel\u003c/a\u003e .",
     "Steve Griffiths, Chief Operating Officer of London Underground, said:",
     "'The six weeks of world class rugby action is now well underway, but the nature of Rugby World Cup 2015 means that busy periods will change as the tournament unfolds. This working week, the focus is squarely on Stratford. Londoners are advised to plan ahead so they can continue to get around easily and ensure they are making the most of this great tournament.'",
     "This weekend there will also be matches at Twickenham (20:00 Saturday 26 September) and Wembley (16:45 Sunday 27 September). Public transport and roads around Twickenham and Wembley will be much busier up to three hours before and two hours after the matches.",
     "By the time of the final on Saturday 31 October there will have been 17 matches across three London venues - The Stadium, Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, Wembley Stadium and Twickenham Stadium, the home of English Rugby.",
     "More than one million spectators are expected in London over the six-week Tournament with large numbers of people enjoying the rugby atmosphere at bars, pubs and Fanzones across the Capital. On match days, the Fanzone at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park is only for ticket holders. Spectators are encouraged to use the bespoke Rugby World Cup 2015 journey planner and travel information at \u003ca href=\"http://rugbyworldcup.com/journeyplanner\"\u003erugbyworldcup.com/journeyplanner\u003c/a\u003e and the detailed venue travel guides available at \u003ca href=\"http://rugbyworldcup.com/travel\"\u003erugbyworldcup.com/travel\u003c/a\u003e . In addition spectators can use the Rugby World Cup 2015 app to plan routes to match venues and Fanzone, and get live updates via @RWC2015Travel. TfL Travel Ambassadors and magenta signage will also be in place across the network directing fans to rugby venues.",
     "TfL, the boroughs and the tournament organisers, England Rugby 2015, have engaged extensively with residents, commuters and businesses in the venue areas to ensure they are aware of the tournament and any impact it may have on them.",
