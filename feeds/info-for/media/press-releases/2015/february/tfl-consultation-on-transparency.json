     "Transport for London (TfL) is asking for final contributions to its consultation on transparency by Sunday 8 March.",
     "Customers and stakeholders are being asked for their views on the usefulness of the wide range of information that is currently published and are being invited to suggest further information that they would like to see made available as a matter of course. Responses to the consultation will be used to create a Transparency Strategy which will be published in the summer of 2015.",
     "TfL's purpose is to keep London working and growing and to make life in the Capital better. With 30 million journeys on its network every day TfL is responsible for delivering a huge range of transport services and investment for London. Openness and transparency about how this is delivered is helping to strengthen relationships with customers, stakeholders and businesses, and is improving the services that TfL provides.",
     "Sir Peter Hendy CBE, London's Transport Commissioner, said:",
     "'We are committed to being open and transparent about what we do and we are making more information publicly available on our decisions, performance and finances than ever. We want to make sure we are publishing what people want and in a way that they find helpful and I am grateful for all the feedback we have received so far.  Our consultation closes on 8 March and I encourage final contributions by then.'",
     "The TfL website provides a vast amount of regularly updated data and information covering fares, financial and operational performance, customer satisfaction, journey patterns, and progress on modernising London's public transport and roads networks. This explains how London's transport network is managed and how every penny of TfL's income is reinvested to improve transport.",
     "There is a dedicated transparency page on the TfL website and a 'publications and reports' section to make finding information easy tfl.gov.uk/transparency",
     "A range of documents detail TfL's financial and operational performance, including:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Business Plan - a 10 year plan of  investment and operational improvements and the financial resources required for their delivery;\",\"Annual Budget - how the first year of the Business Plan will be delivered, including that year's detailed budget and performance targets;\",\"Annual Report and Statement of Accounts - overall performance in the previous financial year including investment and operational performance, staff remuneration and statutory accounts;\",\"Operational and Financial Performance Report - quarterly reporting setting out performance against the annual budget;\",\"Investment Programme Report - quarterly reporting on progress of the investment programme against annual budget and milestones;\",\"Commissioner's report to the Board - the main highlights of TfL's activities and performance since the previous Board meeting; and\",\"Annual report for Health, Safety and Environment - to provide stakeholders with additional information on these core areas of our business.\"]}",
     "Since 2010 TfL has also provided real-time free of charge open data. It has enabled new and innovative ways for customers to obtain travel information and services. Developers have been able to access over 50 data feeds \u003ca href=\"http://tfl.gov.uk/developers\"\u003etfl.gov.uk/developers\u003c/a\u003e to create apps which complement the information TfL itself delivers directly to customers. TfL data now powers over 360 travel apps, most of which are free of charge. This represents an 87 per cent increase in the number of products available in the last year.",
     "The consultation closes on Sunday 8 March. Customers and stakeholders can respond by visiting: \u003ca href=\"http://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/policy/transparency\"\u003econsultations.tfl.gov.uk/policy/transparency\u003c/a\u003e ",
