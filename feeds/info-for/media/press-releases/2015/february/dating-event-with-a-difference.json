     "Transport for London (TfL) and MySingleFriend.com are hosting a free dating event on board MBNA Thames Clippers and the Emirates Air Line on Thursday 12 February. Singles and their loyal wingmen and wingwomen are invited to take to the river and skies to find a date for their single friends in two romantic settings.\u003cbr /\u003eRegistration for the event is free at mysinglefriend.com/wingman. On the night, singletons and their friends will enjoy a moonlit boat ride on a MBNA Thames Clippers before embarking on speed-dating with a twist on the Emirates Air Line - London's only cable car.",
     "The evening kicks off at 6.45pm at the London Eye Pier. Daters will travel along the river to North Greenwich on board MBNA Thames Clippers, with host and comedian Matt Reed on hand to entertain the crowd and get them ready for a memorable night.",
     "After disembarking at North Greenwich, singles and their wingmen and wingwomen will take to the skies on the Emirates Air Line, spending the twenty minute trip mingling with other pairs and taking in the views of the London skyline at night. Guests can then continue their evening getting to know each other in The O2 at All Bar One, where they will get discounted beverages and promotions.",
     "Danny Price, TfL's Head of the Emirates Air Line said: `Romance isn't the first thing that comes to mind when most people think of transport, yet a boat trip along the Thames and a cable car flight above it are two very romantic ways to experience inspiring views of London after dark. In fact, both have seen a couple of marriage proposals before. We hope the evening provides a dating event with a difference and the sparkling lights of London set the mood for romance.'",
     "Sarah Beeny, MySingleFriend.com's founder, said: `We wanted to offer a completely unique dating event which people would never forget. What could set the scene for romance more than a boat ride before taking to the skies and admiring the view below? Experiencing something completely different makes people more open to new possibilities, so it's the perfect environment for meeting people. Plus with a wingman in tow, it makes it even more fun. Our wingmen might not have Cupid's wings, but London's only cable car comes a pretty close second.'",
