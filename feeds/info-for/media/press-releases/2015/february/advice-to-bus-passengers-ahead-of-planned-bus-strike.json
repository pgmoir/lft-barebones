     "Transport for London (TfL) is advising bus passengers to check the TfL website for the latest information ahead of planned strike action by members of the Unite the union (Unite), who work for London's bus companies, which is due to affect bus services on Friday (13 February) and Monday 16 February.",
     "The strike - the result of a dispute between Unite and the bus companies over driver pay and conditions - will affect services from around 4am on Friday 13 February and also night bus services operating on the Friday night into Saturday morning.  Bus services over the weekend will be unaffected and will operate as normal.",
     "All of TfL's other public transport services will be operating as normal should the planned action go ahead.",
     "Mike Weston, TfL's Director of Buses, said: `I am very sorry that the leadership of Unite again seems intent on disrupting the journeys of bus passengers and losing bus drivers even more pay.  We urge Unite to call off the strikes and instead meet with the bus companies individually to resolve their differences.",
     "`Only 16 per cent of bus drivers voted for strike action and many more buses ran last week compared to January's strike.",
     "`Bus driver rates of pay have been negotiated and agreed between Unite and the bus companies individually under a long-standing and jointly agreed process.  This process has been in place for more than 20 years and has regularly resulted in pay rises above the rate of inflation.",
     "`As in all professions, bus drivers have different levels of experience and it is only right that this can be reflected in pay.  A 'levelling up' of pay to the highest rates would result in higher fares and cuts to bus services for passengers and fewer jobs for bus drivers.'",
