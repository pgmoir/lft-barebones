     "Transport for London (TfL) is advising customers who use London Underground's London Bridge station, that work is taking place to replace the lift which runs from the main ticket hall down to the Jubilee line platforms.",
     "The lift replacement work will begin on Tuesday 24 February and is expected to be completed by August 2015.  While the lift is replaced there will be no step-free access at London Bridge station to and from the Jubilee line. There will also be no step-free interchange between the Jubilee line and Northern line or National Rail.  Customers can still interchange step-free between National Rail and Northern line, via the Borough High Street entrance.",
     "The current lift, which operates using a hydraulic system, has been in use for 15 years and is now due to be replaced to ensure its reliability.  Its replacement will be a motorised lift, which is more energy efficient and reliable.  The motorised lift will also require less maintenance.",
     "Nick Brown, Chief Operating Officer for London Underground, said: `This new lift will provide customers with a more efficient and more reliable service.  I am sorry for the disruption this improvement work will cause but customers will experience the benefit of a more efficient and reliable lift service once the installation work is complete.'",
     "Customers requiring step-free access to and from the Jubilee line should use buses to nearby Waterloo, Bermondsey or Southwark stations. To interchange between the Northern and Jubilee lines, customers can change at King's Cross St. Pancras and Green Park",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"London Underground (LU) is undertaking a major programme of renewal which will inevitably result in some disruption for customers, but TfL is working hard to provide information and alternative travel options.  The work is essential to provide for London's growing transport needs now, and into the future.\",\"TfL is urging all Londoners and Tube, London Overground, London Tramlink and DLR customers to \\\"check before you travel\\\" at weekends, allowing extra journey time where necessary.
