     "Transport for London (TfL) is warning bus passengers that their journey will be disrupted today (Thursday 5 February) due to strike action called by the leadership of the Unite the Union (Unite).",
     "Almost half (47 per cent) of the buses which normally operate at this time are currently running.  This is more than at this time during the last strike in January when 30 per cent were running.  Bus customers are being encouraged to check before they travel at \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/campaign/bus-strike\"\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk/campaign/bus-strike\u003c/a\u003e .",
     "Customers will be kept informed throughout the day through regular website updates and the usual electronic signs at around 2,500 bus stops.  It is very difficult to predict in advance the level of service that will operate today on London's 700 specific bus routes, so customers are advised to check the TfL website regularly for updates.",
     "Mike Weston, TfL's Director of Buses, said:",
     "'I am very sorry that the leadership of Unite is intent on disrupting the journeys of London's 6.5 million daily bus passengers, especially given that only 16 per cent of bus drivers voted for strike action.",
     "'Bus driver rates of pay have been negotiated and agreed between Unite and the bus companies individually under a long-standing and jointly agreed process.  This has regularly resulted in pay rises above the rate of inflation.",
     "'As in all professions, bus drivers have different levels of experience and it is only right that this can be reflected in pay.  A 'levelling up' of pay to the highest rates would result in higher fares and cuts to bus services for passengers and fewer jobs for bus drivers.",
     "'Today's strike is likely to mean significant disruption to bus services and I urge customers to please check our website for the latest news.  We are getting up-to-date information to customers as quickly as possible to ensure that they can continue to get around the city.'",
     "The strike is affecting services from around 4am this morning and will affect night bus services operating tonight into Friday morning.  Bus services during the day on Friday 6 February should operate as normal.",
     "The strike is over a dispute between Unite and a number of private bus companies over bus driver pay and conditions.  Less than 16 per cent of the bus drivers in London voted in favour of industrial action.",
     "Customers will be kept informed of the status of their bus services in a range of ways, including:",
