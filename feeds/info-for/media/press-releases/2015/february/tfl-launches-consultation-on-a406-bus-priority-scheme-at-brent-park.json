     "Transport for London (TfL) has launched a consultation on proposals to improve the junction of the A406 North Circular Road with Brentfield Road and Drury Way in the London Borough of Brent.",
     "The consultation, which closes on Sunday 29 March 2015, is part of TfL's Road Modernisation Plan and will deliver a significant Bus Priority scheme that will reduce journey times for bus passengers on route 206, which runs between Wembley Park and Kilburn Park.",
     "The proposals allow buses to take a more direct route from Brent Park into Brentfield Road, with the creation of a new southbound bus lane and the introduction of bus activated signals in Drury Way.  There would also be a new left-turn slip road from the westbound A406 into Brentfield Road reducing delays for traffic and bus routes using the A406.  Pedestrians crossing Brentfield Road would also benefit from a dedicated phase in the traffic lights.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Supporting London's growth\"}",
     "Lilli Matson, TfL's Head of Strategy and Outcome Planning, said: 'This Bus Priority scheme would mean shorter journey times for passengers, helping improve the efficiency of our bus services and supporting London's growth.  These works will also deliver benefits for other road users and pedestrians.",
     "'The proposals in this consultation are an example of how these types of schemes can deliver significant benefits at a local level - allowing buses to move around the city more freely, avoid traffic hotspots and offer customers an even more reliable service.'",
     "Route 206 runs from Wembley Park to Kilburn Park via Brent Park, Harlesden and Brondesbury.  It received at 25 per cent increase in capacity and frequency in April 2014, reflecting strong growth in demand.",
     "Full details of the consultation can be found at: \u003ca href=\"https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/roads/a406-brentfield-road\"\u003ehttps://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/roads/a406-brentfield-road\u003c/a\u003e ",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Investment\"}",
     "Since TfL was formed in 2000 it has invested strongly in London's bus network - resulting in a 69 % increase in passenger numbers.  London Buses now carry more than 2.4 billion passengers a year, which equates to half of all bus journeys made in England.  In recognition of the continued need to invest in bus services - with a increase in demand from the city's rapidly growing population - TfL's latest Business Plan has dedicated around £500 million to improve the network over the period from 2015/16 to 2020/21.  This will include funding for over 500 extra buses, which will create capacity for an extra 2.9 million customer journeys each week.  There is also an additional £200 million which will be invested in supporting the reliability of the bus network at a local level with bus priority schemes.  A further £25 million will be used to fund customer-focused bus driver training to improve customer service.",
     "TfL's continuing £4bn Road Modernisation Plan represents the biggest investment in London's roads in a generation, including hundreds of transformational projects within the existing road network.  Using radical ideas and innovative designs, the plan will make London's roads greener, safer and more attractive for the benefit of all Londoners."
