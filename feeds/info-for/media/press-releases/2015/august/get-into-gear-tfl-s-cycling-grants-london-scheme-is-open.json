It offers funding to community groups such as residents' associations, charities and youth groups for projects that encourage people of all ages and backgrounds to cycle safely.",

Projects that have previously received cycling grants from TfL will be eligible for top-up grants up to £3,000 to help them continue delivering existing initiatives. The deadline for funding applications is 21 September.",
     "Ben Plowden, TfL's Director of Surface Strategy and Planning, said: 'London is experiencing phenomenal growth in cycling, and we are committed to helping everyone learn how to cycle safely through our Cycling Grants London programme.",
