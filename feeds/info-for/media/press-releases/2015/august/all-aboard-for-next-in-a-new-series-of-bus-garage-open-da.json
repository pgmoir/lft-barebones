     "On Saturday 5 September, Camberwell Bus Garage will open its doors to members of the public in the next of a series of bus garage open days following the success of such events as part of last year's Year of the Bus.",
     "Visitors to Camberwell Bus Garage, which is one of the Capital's largest garages and is operated by Go-Ahead London, will get the chance to:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"View Go-Ahead London's stunning static bus display - from vintage buses to a New Routemaster\",\"Be inspired by the 'Innovation Corner' where visitors can learn about how different buses - from hybrids to flywheels - operate\",\"Enjoy a trip on a vintage bus\",\"Take a ride through the bus wash\",\"Visit an array of stalls and stands selling bus memorabilia, refreshments and face painting\",\"Talk to staff about becoming a bus driver at the Recruitment Stand\"]}",
     "As with previous bus garage open days, all proceeds generated from the event will be donated to charity.  Proceeds from this open day will go to Trinity Hospice, who have provided free care for dying people and their families for over 120 years.  They are committed to helping people live life to the full and Go-Ahead London is proud to be supporting such a local and well deserved charity.",
     "Mike Weston, TfL's Director of Buses, said: `Buses are a vital daily service for millions and one that links homes to jobs, schools and hospitals in every part of the Capital.  They are the backbone, and often the forgotten workhorses, of London's transport network and these open days are a great opportunity for the public to come and learn more about their local bus services.'",
     "Sheldon Malcolm, Go-Ahead London's Communication Manager, said: \"This year's open day at Camberwell garage will again be in support of Lambeth Trinity Hospice charity.",
     "`It will be a fantastic day for the whole family as well as bus enthusiasts.  Come along to what is going to be an exciting and fun-filled event, we hope to see you on the 5th September.'",
     "In 2014, TfL held a number of bus garage open days as part of celebrations to mark the Year of the Bus, in partnership with London Transport Museum and the Capital's bus operators.  This was part of a programme of events and activities which were held throughout 2014 to celebrate the role that London buses, bus drivers and the staff who support them play in keeping the Capital moving, and mark a number of important anniversaries.  These included 60 years since the creation of the original and iconic Routemaster, 75 years since the launch of its predecessor the RT-type bus, and 100 years since hundreds of London buses were sent to the Western Front to play a crucial role during the First World War.",
     "Other London bus garages opening their doors this year are Willesden garage on Saturday 19 September and Westbourne Park garage on Saturday 10 October."
