     "Transport for London (TfL) is advising customers of the measures it has put in place to help keep London moving during industrial action on the Tube this week.",
     "Union leaders have called a co-ordinated period of strike action starting on the evening of Wednesday 5 August. Customers are advised to complete their Tube journeys by 18:30 on Wednesday afternoon and to travel earlier if possible. Tube services are expected to be exceptionally busy between 16:30 and 18:30.",
     "There will be no Tube services at all on Thursday.",
     "Customers who are able to change their travel time are strongly advised to travel outside peak hours on Wednesday afternoon and Thursday, and all customers are advised to allow more time for their journeys.",
     "Staff on the DLR, London Overground, the bus network, tram and TfL Rail services are not on strike. These services will run as normal, but they will be much busier than usual and customers are strongly advised to, if possible, travel outside of the morning and evening peaks.",
     "Many locations in central London are easily accessible from mainline rail stations, and TfL will have more than 600 travel ambassadors on hand to help Londoners, visitors and tourists get to their destinations on foot, by bus, by Santander Cycles or by other means.  Around 250 extra buses are being provided to boost capacity on the main commuter corridors and to and from mainline stations and additional Santander Cycles hubs will mean more bikes will be available at the busiest locations. Extra river services are also being provided during peak hours on Thursday. These services will be very busy and customers are asked to bear with the transport staff who are at work and trying to help them get around.",
     "Steve Griffiths, London Underground's Chief Operating Officer, said: `I am sorry that the journeys of our customers will once again be disrupted by unnecessary strike action. After listening to the unions, we put forward an extremely fair revised offer, which makes clear commitments to support work life balance and rewards our people for their hard work. We urge the unions to call off the strike, put the new offer to their members and avoid further disruption to Londoners.  We remain available for talks with the unions at any time.'",
