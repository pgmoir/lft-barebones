     "Transport for London (TfL) is once again encouraging Carnival-goers, road users and customers to plan their journeys ahead of Europe's biggest street festival. On Sunday 30 and Monday 31 August, the Carnival celebrates the 'emergence of carnival' as part of the build up to the 50th Anniversary in 2016. Travel advice is available at \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/notting-hill\"\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk/notting-hill\u003c/a\u003e .",
     "The origins of the Notting Hill Carnival date back to 1964 when the Capital's Caribbean communities began celebrating their culture and traditions. What is now known as the two day Carnival officially began in 1966 and includes a fantastic selection of live music, which ranges from reggae to dub to salsa. The celebrations also include soca floats and steel bands.",
     "TfL services will continue to keep the Capital moving during the annual three day event. Its dedicated Carnival webpage has details on how transport services will run during London's busiest annual event, including a map showing the nearest stations and bus routes. Follow @TfLTrafficNews, @TfLBusAlerts and @TfLTravelAlerts on Twitter for all the latest information.",
     "Motorists are advised to avoid driving in the Notting Hill area and West London across the Bank Holiday weekend, as a number of road closures will be in place from Saturday 29 August to early morning on Tuesday 1 September. The easiest ways to travel to and from the Carnival will be by Tube, bus, cycling or walking. However, some stations close to the Carnival will be closed or will be exit only, and some bus routes will be diverted or stop short of their journey.
