     "Transport for London (TfL) confirmed that work to refurbish the 30 year-old lifts at the station will now begin on Monday 14 March rather than Monday 4 January.  Once the lifts are refurbished customers will benefit from faster and more reliable lifts.",
     "The move comes after TfL reviewed its plans following customer concerns about having Caledonian Road closed at the same time as Tufnell Park Tube station, which is having its lifts replaced.",
     "Gareth Powell, Director of Strategy for London Underground, said: \"We always keep our plans under review to see if we can improve them.  In this instance we're able to act on the concerns of our customers and move the closure date of Caledonian Road to later in the year. When the works are complete everyone will benefit from a new, more reliable service.\"",
     "The current lifts need to be refurbished to ensure they work reliably - with the existing lifts failing once a week on average, causing disruption to customers.",
     "The nature of the work means that while this essential upgrade is carried out, the station will be closed until the end of October 2016.",
     "Lift refurbishment in Tube stations is a lengthy process, with the removal and replacement of hundreds of mechanical and electrical parts taking place in a cramped working space. Because of this, replacing lifts at a station like Caledonian Road - with a single lift shaft that continues deep underground - takes some months.",
     "TfL also announced that work to replace two lifts at Tufnell Park station will finish ahead of schedule, meaning the station will re-open two weeks early on Monday 7 March.",
     "Notes to Editors:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"While the lifts at Caledonian Road Tube station are refurbished the station will be closed from Monday 14 March 2016 until the end of October 2016.\",\"TfL is delivering one of the world's largest programmes of capital investment, which includes building Crossrail, modernising Tube services and stations, improving the road network and making roads safer for cyclists and pedestrians. Continued investment is essential so that as our city grows, everyone who lives, works and visits, has the transport they need.\",\"London Underground is undertaking a major programme of renewal which will inevitably result in some disruption for customers, but TfL is working hard to provide information and alternative travel options.  The work is essential to provide for London's growing transport needs now, and into the future.\",\"Information including a video on how we replace lifts on our network can be found here: \\u003ca href=\\\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/campaign/tube-improvements/behind-the-scenes/escalator-refurbishment?intcmp=14562\\\"\\u003ehttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/campaign/tube-improvements/behind-the-scenes/escalator-refurbishment?intcmp=14562\\u003c/a\\u003e \",\"TfL is advising all Londoners and Tube, London Overground, London Tramlink and DLR customers to \\\"check before you travel\\\" at weekends, allowing extra journey time where necessary.
