     "Transport services and town centres in North London have been given a New Year boost, as the Mayor and Transport for London (TfL) have confirmed £148 million in funding for improvement projects in the London's boroughs in 2016/17.",
     "The annual borough funding is provided by TfL to help the boroughs pay for local transport projects set out in their Local Implementation Plans (LIPs). LIPs are plans that show how the boroughs will support the Mayor's Transport Strategy in their area. For 2016/17, TfL's financial support for the boroughs' LIPs has been maintained at £147.8 million and will fund improvements that benefit local communities.",
     "The funding will support a range of different transport projects across North London delivered by the boroughs. Local areas will see safer roads, better public spaces, improved walking facilities and cycling made safer and easier.",
     "Each borough will receive:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Barnet - £4.8 million including £200,000 towards introducing 20mph limits around nine schools across the borough\",\"Camden - £4.9 million including £2 million towards the West End project, which will transform the area around Tottenham Court Road and Gower Street and will deliver high quality public spaces and streets\",\"Haringey - £2.7 million including £122,000 to support a major scheme around White Hart Lane to widen, resurface footways and create step free routes\",\"Enfield - £5.4 million including £1.1m for accessibility, road safety and urban realm improvements around Ponders End\",\"Islington - £2 million including £350,000 for borough-wide road safety improvements, such as junction improvements, traffic calming measures and pedestrian crossings in areas where higher than average accident statistics have been recorded.\"]}",
     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson MP, said: `This latest round of funding will help to transform scores of locations in all four corners of our great city. It is specifically targeted to help make our roads, town centres and open spaces more attractive places with better facilities for walking and safer cycling. By helping the boroughs deliver on important local transport schemes, we can help to spur jobs and growth across London.'",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Mike Brown MVO, said: `People in North London will see real improvements to their local areas as a result of this funding. Working with North London boroughs, hundreds of transport projects will be delivered that will benefit pedestrians and road users, through safer streets and improved public squares and shopping areas. These improvements will help transform communities and boost the local economy.'",
     "In addition to funding for boroughs, TfL is working with them to help further improve the efficiency of the delivery of projects, ensuring value for money and keeping disruption to a minimum.",
     "Last year, the boroughs in North London used TfL funding to deliver a range of improvements for local communities, through safer junctions, reduced traffic speeds and better walking routes.",
     "Significant projects in North London awarded funding last year included:",
