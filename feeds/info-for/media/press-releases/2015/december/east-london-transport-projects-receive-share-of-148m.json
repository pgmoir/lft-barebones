     "The annual borough funding is provided by TfL to help the boroughs pay for local transport projects set out in their Local Implementation Plans (LIPs). LIPs are plans that show how the boroughs will support the Mayor's Transport Strategy in their area. For 2016/17, TfL's financial support for the boroughs' LIPs has been maintained at £147.8 million and will fund improvements that benefit local communities.",
     "The funding will support a range of different transport projects across East London delivered by the boroughs. Local areas will see safer roads, better public spaces, improved walking facilities and cycling made safer and easier.",

These improvements will help transform communities and boost the local economy.'",
