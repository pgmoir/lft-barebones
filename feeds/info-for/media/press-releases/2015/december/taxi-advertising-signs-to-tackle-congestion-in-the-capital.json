     "Taxi-top digital advertising boards are to display traffic information in an innovative trial aimed at cutting congestion in London.",
     "From today, Transport for London (TfL) are trialling the technology with BrightMove Media to enable the Capital's iconic taxis to encourage other road users to avoid congested roads.",
     "Initially, targeted messages will inform road users of traffic levels at 40 to 50 areas where there are known traffic delays.  In the future, the technology could be used to provide real-time updates on incidents across London's road network.  Messages will be displayed on around 200 taxis fitted with the electronic boards using GPS technology to ensure that the information is accurate and up-to-date.",
     "Garrett Emmerson, TfL's Chief Operating Officer for Surface Transport, said: `This trial is an innovative new way to reach road users in London and keep them informed of traffic conditions.  Using the Capital's fleet of taxis to get real-time traffic information out will inform other drivers of any disruption on the network, helping them to avoid the most congested routes.  It is one of many ways we are focusing our attention on keeping London moving, particularly during the current success-driven boom in construction seen across London.",
     "Jamie Lindsay, BrightMove Media's Chief Executive, said: `Broadcasting congestion information to Londoners on iconic black taxis highlights the unique technological and programming capabilities our software possesses.  This trial will keep Londoners up to date with live traffic conditions and events in the Capital - exactly the kind of information that they need. We are delighted to be partnering with TfL in delivering this scheme.'",
     "The trial is the latest in a range of initiatives TfL is undertaking to keep traffic moving on London's roads.  Last week, a new team of enforcement officers, tasked with problem-solving issues such as inconsiderate driving and parking that can cause congestion, was announced.  As well as this, the use of road side digital signs on key corridors keeps drivers aware of traffic conditions, allowing them to take alternative routes to avoid disruption.  SCOOT technology, proven to reduce delays by up to 12 per cent, is also continuing to be expanded across the Capital."
