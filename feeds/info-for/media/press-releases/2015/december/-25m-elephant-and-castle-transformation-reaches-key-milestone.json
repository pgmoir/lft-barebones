     "From Sunday 6 December road users will see a drastic improvement to the notorious Elephant and Castle junction when it returns to two-way traffic for the first time in 50 years.",
     "The roundabout, which has seen more than 80 collisions since 2012, will be removed, marking the first key milestone in plans to make the area safer for all road users, including pedestrians and cyclists, by next year.",
     "Space created by removing the roundabout will be converted into a new high-quality, attractive public space, which will be accessible and enhance the area.",
     "Work will continue to deliver further benefits in the area, which have been supported by over 80% of respondents to a 2014 consultation, and include:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Subways replaced with new pedestrian crossings allowing people to cross directly, easily and safely between Tube, bus and local amenities at all times of the day\",\"New dedicated cycle routes created through and around the junction to improve safety for cyclists\",\"Increasing passenger space, improving access from street level and providing step-free access to the Northern line platforms at the Northern line Tube station at Elephant \\u0026 Castle\"]}",
     "A new 20mph speed limit will also be introduced to Elephant and Castle in spring 2016 as part of Transport for London's (TfL's) work to make central London safer, pleasant and more attractive for all.",
     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson MP, said: `This major improvement of Elephant and Castle is clearly progressing and everyone, from cyclists to pedestrians, is already beginning to see a massive difference.  When the work is complete in spring next year this area will be transformed and its true potential will be realised with more homes and jobs being created.'",
     "Garrett Emmerson, Chief Operating Officer of Surface Transport, at TfL said: `Our work to improve the Elephant and Castle area will soon reach a key milestone, the removal of the roundabout. The return of two-way traffic to Elephant and Castle will help rejuvenate the area. An attractive peninsula and safer roads for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians will help transform this area into a place people want to be.'",
     "From 6 December, in addition to the roads being two-way traffic, left turns from Newington Causeway towards New Kent Road and right turns from New Kent Road to Newington Causeway will be banned.",
     "Road users have been advised of the change of traffic through hoardings in front of the future peninsula showing the countdown until the removal of the roundabout.  The route 100 bus will be re-routed between Newington Causeway and London Road but all bus stops will continue to be served as usual.",
     "The project is part-funded by TfL's £360m growth fund, which is creating more than 50,000 homes and 30,000 jobs by supporting 14 transport projects across London that are directly unlocking development.",
     "Ends",
