     "The celebrations will include the Mayor of London's New Year's Eve fireworks, in partnership with Unicef, on the River Thames opposite the Houses of Parliament. The display is ticketed and has sold out, so anyone without a ticket will not be able to get into the viewing areas and are advised to avoid the immediate area around Embankment and South Bank. Those without tickets can watch the action live on BBC1, or bring in the new year at one of the hundreds of other celebrations taking place in restaurants and bars, pubs and clubs across the Capital.",
     "Roads in Central London will start closing to traffic from 14:00 to prepare for the New Year celebrations with all closures in place from 20:00 until 06:00, with some roads re-opening earlier if it is safe to do so. Public transport will be the best way to get around London, although some buses will be on diversion or finish early due to the road closures. It is recommended to plan all journeys ahead by visiting \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/festive\"\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk/festive\u003c/a\u003e .",
     "Most of the road and bridge closures for the New Year's Eve fireworks event will re-open by 06:00 on Fri 1 Jan 2016. However, some will remain closed, with other road closures implemented from 04:00 for the New Year's Day Parade. All roads will re-open around 18:00, or when it's safe to do so.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Mike Brown MVO, said:",

As we prepare to welcome in 2016, we've teamed up with KAYAK.co.uk to ensure that everyone who will be out celebrating will be able to get home safely with free travel on buses and on London Underground, the DLR, the Trams and our rail services.'",
     "People choosing to make their way home by cab are advised to use a black cab or pre-booked minicab to ensure that their journey is safe.",
     "On 1 January 2016, London's annual New Year's Day Parade will take place from 12:00 to 15:30 with more than 8,500 performers representing 20 countries world-wide set to take part.
