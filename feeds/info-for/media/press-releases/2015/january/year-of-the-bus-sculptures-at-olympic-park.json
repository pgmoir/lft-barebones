     "All 60 Year of the Bus sculptures, fresh from trails across London, will go on display one final time over the weekend of 24 and 25 January 2015 at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park before being auctioned for charity.",
     "The event will be one of Transport for London's (TfL's) final celebrations to mark  2014's Year of the Bus, in partnership with London Transport Museum and the capital's bus operators, and is funded entirely by sponsorship.",
     "Painted and adorned by well-known and aspiring artists, the sculptures have been capturing the imagination of Londoners and visitors to the city since last October when they went on display on four walking trails across the capital. Members of the public are now invited to view all of these unique artworks in one place as part of a free family fun weekend which includes:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Free interactive art and music workshops for children and families, and face painting - held within a covered and heated marquee area\",\"The opportunity to meet some of the artists and see one of the final bus sculptures being painted 'live' over the weekend\",\"The chance to view and board a New Routemaster bus and the Year of the Bus mobile exhibition which tells the story of the London Bus and looks to its future\",\"The chance to hop aboard the restored war time 'Battle Bus', back from its tour of the battlefields of France and Belgium, for an insight into the sacrifices made by so many, including bus drivers, mechanics and transport workers during the First World War (Sunday only)\",\"Live entertainment from licensed buskers from the London Underground Busking Scheme\",\"A chance to learn more about our charity partners who will benefit from the charity auction and register your interest to attend\",\"The opportunity to ascend the UK's tallest sculpture - the ArcelorMittal Orbit - to get a bird's eye view of the 60 bus sculptures, Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and the city stretching beyond (normal admission prices apply)\",\"Explore Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, which hosted the London 2012 Games.\"]}",
     "Leon Daniels, Managing Director for Surface Transport at TfL, said: `The Year of the Bus sculptures have surprised and delighted Londoners and visitors to the capital for the past couple of months. This free event will offer a fantastic last opportunity for anyone who didn't manage to spot all 60 sculptures to see them all in one place before they are auctioned to raise funds for three admirable charities.'",
     "The sculptures, which were delivered with creative events company Wild in Art, will be auctioned in the spring to raise invaluable funds for three charities: Kids Company, Transaid and London Transport Museum.  To view all of the lots and make a bid, please visit \u003ca href=\"http://www.I-bidder.com/yearofthebus\"\u003ewww.I-bidder.com/yearofthebus\u003c/a\u003e ",
     "David Goldstone, Chief Executive of the London Legacy Development Corporation, said: `I can't think of a better place to showcase one of the capital's most iconic objects - the London bus - than Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. The 60 sculptures will look fantastic set among the unique venues and landscaped grounds of the Park. And we are sure the charity auction will be a huge success.'",
     "Events and activities were held throughout 2014 to celebrate the Year of the Bus, specifically the role that London buses, bus drivers and the staff who support them play in keeping the capital moving.  The Year of the Bus also marked a number of important anniversaries including 60 years since the creation of the original and iconic Routemaster, 75 years since the launch of its predecessor the RT-type bus, and 100 years since hundreds of London buses were sent to the Western Front to play a crucial role during the First World War.",
     "High profile collaborations included working with the world-famous Fender guitar manufacturer whose Stratocaster guitar celebrated its 60th anniversary last year; with LEGO to install an operational bus stop and shelter on Regent Street made entirely out of LEGO and a special Routemaster Google Doodle on the Google.co.uk homepage.",
     "The Year of the Bus was supported by and delivered in partnership with Exterion Media, Abellio, Arriva London, Clear Channel UK, Go-Ahead London, Metroline, RATP Dev UK, Stagecoach, Wrightbus, Optare and Telent Technology Services.  Cubic Transportation System Ltd sponsored 10 of the sculptures.",
