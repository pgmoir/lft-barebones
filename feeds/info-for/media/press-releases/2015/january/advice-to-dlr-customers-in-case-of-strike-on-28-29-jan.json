     "Transport for London (TfL) has today advised DLR customers to check the TfL website for the latest information about planned strike action by the RMT union, which would affect services on Wednesday 28 January and Thursday 29 January.",
     "The planned strike is the result of a dispute between the RMT and KeolisAmey Docklands, which operates the DLR on behalf of TfL, over the outsourcing of maintenance work.",
     "It is scheduled to take place between 4:00am on Wednesday 28 January and 3.59am on Friday 30 January. It is unlikely that any DLR services will operate during these times if the strike goes ahead. Services should operate as normal on Friday. All other TfL services which connect to the DLR network will be operating as usual.",
     "Enhanced bus services will operate on key routes along the DLR network and there will also be replacement bus services to connect DLR customers to the Tube network.",

     "Rory O'Neill, TfL's Director of DLR, said: `If the strike goes ahead, KeolisAmey Docklands say that it is unlikely that any DLR services will run.  TfL bus, Tube and rail services will be operating as normal, extra buses will run on key routes and staff will be available to help. Customers are advised to use our website to plan ahead. As other TfL services are likely to be busier than normal, as ever, we ask customers who are able to consider avoiding the busiest times if they can.",

     "TfL staff will also be on hand to provide travel information and advice. Customers wishing to travel to London City Airport are advised to the take either the replacement bus service from Canning Town, TfL bus services or a taxi.",
     "Customers are also reminded that as part of Network Rail's rebuild of London Bridge mainline rail station, Southeastern services to and from Charing Cross are not calling at London Bridge and Thameslink services to that station are running a limited service.",
