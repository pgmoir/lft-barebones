     "Transport for London (TfL) has today advised bus passengers to check the TfL website for the latest information about planned strike action by members of the Unite union, who work for London's bus companies, which could affect bus services on Tuesday 13 January.",
     "The planned strike, the result of a dispute between Unite and the bus companies over driver pay and conditions, is planned to take place between 00:01 and 23:59 on Tuesday 13 January.  This would affect services throughout Tuesday 13 January and also night bus services operating on the Tuesday night into Wednesday morning.  Bus services during the day on Wednesday 14 January should operate as normal.",
     "Less than 16% of the bus drivers in London voted in favour of industrial action but, should the strike take place, services across London will be patchy with some areas affected more than others.",
     "All of TfL's other public transport services will be operating as normal should the planned action by Unite go ahead.",
     "TfL is calling for Unite and the bus companies to swiftly resolve the dispute so that passengers are not disrupted.",
     "Leon Daniels, TfL's Managing Director of Surface Transport, said: `It is extremely disappointing that Unite has decided to threaten unnecessary disruption, especially given the low turnout for the ballot and low numbers voting for the strike. Bus drivers' pay and conditions are a matter for the bus companies and Unite to discuss, as it has been for 20 years, and we would urge them to seek a swift and fair resolution for the sake of our passengers`",
     "If the strike takes place, services across London will be patchy and I urge customers to please check our website for the latest news.  We'll be getting up-to-date information to customers as quickly as possible to ensure that they can continue to get around the city.'",
     "Passengers will also be kept informed of the status of their services in a range of ways, including:",
