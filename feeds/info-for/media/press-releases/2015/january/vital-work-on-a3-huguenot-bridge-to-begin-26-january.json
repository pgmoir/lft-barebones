     "As part of its £4 billion Road Modernisation Plan, Transport for London (TfL) is carrying out major maintenance works to the A3 Huguenot bridge in Wandsworth.",
     "The 35 year old bridge, which carries westbound traffic from Battersea Rise to Wandsworth High Street over the A214 Trinity Road, needs to be re-waterproofed and resurfaced. This will ensure this vital part of the road network can continue serving London for years to come.",
     "TfL appreciates this is a major and important route into Wandsworth Town Centre and its state of the art 24/7 traffic control centre will monitor this location during the works to ensure that any delays are kept to a minimum. Letters have also been sent to local residents advising them of the works and live traffic information will be put on the TfL website to allow people to plan their journeys before they start.",
     "Roadside message signs will also alert drivers to the closure both in advance and during the works, to help them avoid delays and seek alternative routes, such as via the Wandsworth roundabout. More detailed advice will be available at www.tfl.gov.uk/trafficnews",
     "The work will be carried out until late May 2015 and drivers are advised to check before they travel and plan their journeys while these works are carried out. In order to carry out the carriageway works, two of the four lanes over the structure will need to be closed. The bus lane will be suspended, to ensure that two lanes remain available to all traffic at all times. Work will be carried out from 07:30 to 22:30 Monday to Friday and from 07:30 to 17:30 at weekends.",
     "As part of the scheme, overnight work to refurbish the bearings supporting the structure and install new pigeon netting to the underside of the bridge will also be carried out from Monday 16 February until late May 2015. Both these and the carriageway works will be carried out by the London Highway Alliance, a joint initiative between TfL and London's boroughs to deliver road maintenance and improvements across London.",
     "Dana Skelley, Director of Asset Management for Surface Transport at TfL, said: `Our £4 billion Road Modernisation Plan will ensure that the capital's red routes remain usable for many years to come. We appreciate driver's patience during these vital maintenance works to the A3 Huguenot bridge and are committed to keeping disruption caused by these closures to a minimum. We apologise in advance for any inconvenience caused and ask people to check \u003ca href=\"http://@tfltrafficnews\"\u003e@tfltrafficnews\u003c/a\u003e for the latest traffic news.'",
     "The work to the A3 Huguenot bridge forms part of the wider work being carried out across London as part of TfL's Road Modernisation Plan. With a budget of more than £4 billion from now until 2021/22, this overarching plan represents the biggest investment in London's roads in a generation, including hundreds of transformational projects within the existing road network. Using radical ideas and innovative designs, the plan will make London's roads greener, safer and more attractive for the benefit of all Londoners.",
