     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"First sponsorship deal for Baby on Board badge, which was launched in 2005\",\"Three year deal will generate over £100,000 a year for reinvestment in the public transport and road networks\",\"Famous badge retains its existing design and remains free\"]}",
     " \u003ca href=\"http://notonthehighstreet.com/\"\u003eNotonthehighstreet.com\u003c/a\u003e , the UK's largest curated online marketplace, has become the first sponsor of London Underground's (LU's) Baby on Board badges in an exclusive three year deal.",
     "The sponsorship deal will generate over £100,000 a year over the three year contract and is part of Transport for London's (TfL's) ambitious and creative plans to generate £3.4bn in commercial revenue over the next ten years. The revenue is reinvested back into improving London's public transport and road networks and will help to bear down on fares.",
     "The famous Baby on Board badge has proved a huge success with mums-to-be, with over 130,000 badges handed out for free each year. The sponsorship will mean that the badge will now come with a dedicated notonthehighstreet.com catalogue packed with ideas on everything from announcement cards and original keepsakes, to nursery accessories and more. The catalogue also features hints and tips on travelling on the network, ideas for great places to visit in London with babies and young children, and offers a 10 per cent discount on the \u003ca href=\"http://notonthehighstreet.com/\"\u003enotonthehighstreet.com\u003c/a\u003e website.",
     "The partnership aims to raise awareness of the badge even further and to make the experience of mums-to-be travelling on London's transport network even easier. The badge was first introduced in 2005 to help combat the awkwardness some mums-to-be feel if they have to ask someone to give up their seat. The badge aims to encourage fellow passengers to help make pregnant women feel more comfortable when they are travelling by offering them a seat when they see someone wearing the badge.",
     "The badge will retain its current famous design and will continue to be provided free by TfL. It is available through TfL's website \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/babyonboard\"\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk/babyonboard\u003c/a\u003e as well as at all Tube stations. Dads-to-be as well as family and friends can collect or apply for a badge to give to an expectant mum.",
     "Graeme Craig, TfL's Director of Commercial Development, said: \"We are delighted to have \u003ca href=\"http://notonthehighstreet.com/\"\u003enotonthehighstreet.com\u003c/a\u003e sponsoring our Baby on Board badges. It's fantastic to be helping mums-to-be in London whilst also generating revenue that we can reinvest back into improving the transport network.\"",
     "Ben Carter, Marketing Director, \u003ca href=\"http://notonthehighstreet.com/\"\u003enotonthehighstreet.com\u003c/a\u003e , said: \"We are incredibly excited to announce our partnership with TfL on the sponsorship of the iconic Baby on Board badge. As a company started by two female entrepreneurs and with a large female employee and customer base, we recognise that being a mum-to-be is a special and important time for any woman and understand the value and benefit that baby on board offers expectant mothers and ultimately want to help enhance that experience.\"",
     "This partnership also forms a key part of notonthehighstreet.com's marketing strategy as it looks to build connections with key audiences. \u003ca href=\"http://notonthehighstreet.com/\"\u003enotonthehighstreet.com\u003c/a\u003e , supports a community of over 5,000 small, independent creative businesses and designer makers from across the UK and aims to boost small business by offering their unique, design led products to an online audience of millions.",
     "The sponsorship contract is available on TfL's website \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/contracts\"\u003ehttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/contracts\u003c/a\u003e ",
     "London has one of the most accessible transport networks anywhere in the world, with all bus routes served by low-floor wheelchair accessible buses. All DLR stations are step free and all DLR, London Overground and Tramlink services have priority spaces that can be used for buggies. Buggies can also be used on most Thames boats and the crew will find the best place for them to be located on board. On London Underground 66 stations are step free and the District, Jubilee and Northern line trains have multipurpose areas suitable for buggies and luggage. There are also wheelchair spaces on the Victoria and Metropolitan line trains. Over the next 10 years, TfL will provide step-free access to at least an extra 28 stations across London Underground and the London Overground network, and all stations on the TfL-run Crossrail network will be step-free.",
