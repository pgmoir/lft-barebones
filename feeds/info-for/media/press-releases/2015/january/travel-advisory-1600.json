     "Transport for London (TfL) is continuing to warn bus passengers that their journeys could be significantly disrupted today (Tuesday 13 January) due to strike action called by the leadership of the Unite union.",
     "Around a third of the buses which normally operate at this time are currently running and bus customers are being encouraged to check before they travel at \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/buses\"\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk/buses\u003c/a\u003e .",

     "The bus network carried around a third of its normal number of passengers this morning, and the public transport network as a whole saw almost 90 per cent of regular adult fare paying passengers travelling on the network, with significant numbers choosing to walk or cycle short distances to work.  London has kept moving and working despite the industrial action.",
     "Mike Weston, TfL's Director of Buses, said: 'I am very sorry that the leadership of Unite have chosen to disrupt the journeys of bus passengers, especially given that only 16 per cent of the bus drivers voted for strike action.",
     "'As the bus companies who employ the drivers have said, it makes no sense to pay all drivers precisely the same amount.  As in all professions, bus drivers have different skills and experience and it is only right that this can be reflected in pay.  A 'levelling up' of pay to the highest rates would cost around Â£100 million a year and would result in a cut to bus services, an increase in fares, or both.",
     "'London has one of the best and most extensive bus networks anywhere in the world.  It would be much better if the leadership of Unite actually worked with the bus companies to ensure that it remains that way rather than disrupting bus passengers.'",
     "The strike will affect night bus services operating tonight into Wednesday morning.  Bus services during the day on Wednesday 14 January should operate as normal.",
     "The strike is over a dispute between Unite and a number of private bus companies over bus driver pay and conditions.  Less that 16 per cent of the bus drivers in London voted in favour of industrial action.",
