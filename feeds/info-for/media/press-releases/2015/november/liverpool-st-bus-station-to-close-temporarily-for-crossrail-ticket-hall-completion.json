     "Customers are advised that vital work to build a brand new Crossrail station ticket hall will require the temporary closure of Liverpool Street bus station from Sunday 22 November until spring 2016.",
     "Hoardings around the new Crossrail station building site will need to be extended across Old Broad Street during the ticket hall work, which will prevent entry and exit from the bus station. The temporary closure of the bus station will affect passengers who travel on routes 11, 23, 133, N11 and N133.",
     "To minimise disruption to passengers, affected bus services will operate from nearby bus stops. During the temporary closure, routes 11, N11 and 23 will depart from London Wall (Bus Stop U) outside All Hallows Church.",
     "The last stop for buses towards Liverpool Street will be in Eldon Street (Bus Stop V). Buses in this direction will also be diverted via Princes Street and Moorgate, and will not serve Threadneedle Street or Old Broad Street.",
     "For bus routes 133 and N133, the nearest stop will be in Wormwood Street (Bus Stop Q).  The last stop towards Liverpool Street will also be in Wormwood Street (Bus Stop P).",
     "Crossrail, which will begin service in 2018, will provide passengers across London and the South East with quicker and more reliable journeys, new trains and better stations.",
     "Tony Akers, Transport for London's Head of Bus Operations, said: `I apologise to any customers affected by the temporary closure of Liverpool Street bus station.  We've worked with Crossrail to minimise the bus station closure, which will allow this essential work to be completed.  Once built, the nearby Crossrail station will provide a wider range of accessible transport options to bus passengers.'",
     "Leaflets, including walking maps to the alternative bus stops and route finders are available to customers at the bus station and customer information centre in the days leading up to its closure.",
     "All registered Oyster card holders who regularly use the routes to and from the bus station will also receive emails about the closure with advice on how to plan their journeys until the station re-opens in Spring next year.",
     "Crossrail will bring an extra 1.5 million people to within 45 minutes of central London and help to transform many of the areas through which the route runs, creating jobs, business opportunities and driving regeneration.",
     "For more information and maps regarding the temporary closure of the bus station please visit: \u003ca href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/improvements-and-projects/crossrail\"\u003ehttps://tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/improvements-and-projects/crossrail\u003c/a\u003e "
