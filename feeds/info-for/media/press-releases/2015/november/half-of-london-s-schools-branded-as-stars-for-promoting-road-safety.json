     "The achievements of the highest performing schools in reducing car use, increasing walking and cycling and using public transport more responsibly were celebrated at an annual event at City Hall. Awards were presented for the best primary and secondary school in North, South, East and West London and schools of excellence (in different travel areas).",
     "STARS is a TfL accreditation programme for schools that encourages children, parents and teachers to adopt more sustainable and safer ways of travelling to school. Since 2007, accreditation to STARS has grown from 180 schools to 1,475 in 2015. Schools are judged on the number of initiatives delivered and their success in changing travel behaviour with Bronze, Silver and Gold accreditation levels.",
     "Leon Daniels, Managing Director of TfL Surface Transport, said: `It is fantastic that more schools are joining our STARS programme each year. What children learn now will have a lasting effect on the future of our environment and that's why we want to encourage more schools to sign up and emulate the inspirational work of STARS top performing schools.'\u003cbr /\u003eThe overall best primary and secondary schools in the regions include;",
