     "Transport for London (TfL) is advising customers that journeys on the DLR will continue to be severely disrupted this evening (Wednesday 4 November)  due to a 48-hour strike called by the leadership of the RMT union.",
     "The union is in dispute with KeolisAmey Docklands (KAD), who operate the DLR on behalf of TfL, and the action means that there is currently a very limited service on the DLR network between Canning Town and Prince Regent stations only - this will start winding down from 1845 hrs this evening, with last services expected at around 1910 hrs.  There is no service on the rest of the DLR.",
     "The strike officially ends at 03:58am tomorrow (Thursday 5 November), however there may be some minor delays to the start of services.  KeolisAmey Docklands will work hard to ensure services are running as soon as possible tomorrow. Customers are strongly advised to check the TfL website for travel updates for both this evening and tomorrow morning.",
     "Stations that interchange with the DLR and other key stations on the network - Canning Town, London Bridge, Stratford, West Ham and Shadwell -  have been busier than normal during the morning and evening peaks. Canada Water and Canary Wharf  in particular, will be exceptionally busy this evening and customers who are able to are asked to avoid travelling at the busiest times if possible.",
     "Rory O'Neill, TfL's Director of DLR, said: `We would like to thank customers for their patience during the strike which was called by  the RMT leadership.",
     "`We are very sorry for the disruption this has caused and  would now urge both KeolisAmey Docklands, who operate the DLR on our behalf, and the RMT leadership to get round the table to resolve this dispute through meaningful discussion.'",
     "The Jubilee, Central, District and Hammersmith \u0026 City lines in east London, and London Overground between Highbury and Surrey Quays, are much busier than usual due to the strike.",
     "TfL staff are on hand to provide travel information and advice and customers can keep up-to-date on the status of their services in a range of ways, including:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Up-to-date information on the TfL website at \\u003ca href=\\\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk\\\"\\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk\\u003c/a\\u003e \",\"Travel alerts will be provided through Twitter on @TfL, @TfLTravelAlerts and @LondonDLR\",\"TfL is also providing information to radio and television broadcasts for use in news bulletins\"]}",
     "For those travelling to and from the ExCel centre, the Emirates Air Line services are running today (Wednesday 4 November ) between 0600-2200. Valid travel tickets will be accepted on the Emirates Air Line.",

Customers switching to other services must buy a ticket for the journey they intend to make\",\"Travelcard season tickets will be accepted on alternative services within their zone validity, as normal. Customers travelling outside their zones will be charged a pay as you go fare. This will not be refunded;\",\"Day Travelcards bought in advance may be refunded if surrendered before the day of validity - otherwise no refunds will be given\",\"PAYG users will be charged the appropriate fare for the journey for the service(s) used, whether that's bus, Tube, London Overground, TfL Rail, National Rail or river bus services;\"]}",
