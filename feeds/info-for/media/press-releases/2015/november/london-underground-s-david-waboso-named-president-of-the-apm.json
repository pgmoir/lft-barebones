     "David Waboso CBE, London Underground's Capital Programmes Director, has today been announced as the new President of the Association for Project Management (APM), and will assume the part-time role in the New Year alongside his current position. As President, he will lead the APM's commitment to provide industry-leading knowledge and resources, helping to improve project management across the country. With over 21,150 individual and 550 corporate members, the APM is the largest professional body of its kind in Europe.",
     "David Waboso is an internationally renowned engineer and project manager. He has worked for some of the world's most prestigious clients, engineering and consulting firms and, as Capital Programmes Director for London Underground, is responsible for leading the £1.5bn annual Tube Upgrade Programme - the largest in the company's history. He currently manages a team of over 3,000 colleagues and a supply chain of 20,000 people, delivering on investments that make a difference to millions of Londoners each day. He brings decades of experience in leading major infrastructure projects - both in the UK and abroad - to his new role at the APM.",
     "Steve Wake, APM Chairman, said: `APM President is an important role at an important time for both APM and the profession as a whole. We're delighted that David has agreed to become our new President and become a figurehead and focal point for the profession. It is an exciting time for project management across all sectors, but especially in David's own rail infrastructure sector where programmes such as Crossrail and HS2 continue to raise standards of project delivery.'",
     "David Waboso, London Underground's Capital Programmes Director, said: `With Britain's population set to rise to 70 million over the course of the next decade, investing in infrastructure will be critically important. Professional project management is the key to delivering the vital housing, transport and energy infrastructure we all need for the future. It's an honour to be appointed the new President of the APM and I look forward to leading colleagues across the profession in the New Year.'",
     "The Association for Project Management is the largest professional body of its kind in Europe. It has over 21,650 members and 16,000 people taking its qualifications each year. A registered charity founded in 1972, the association is dedicated to the development of professional project management standards through its five Dimensions of Professionalism to achieve its vision of a world in which all projects succeed. It is the UK member of the International Project Management Association"
