     "Work to build another tram platform at Wimbledon is now complete which will allow a further four trams an hour to serve the stop from Spring 2016 when the new trams enter service.",
     "The additional platform, which is part of Transport for London's (TfL's) investment programme, will allow 12 trams to run every hour along the busy route from Wimbledon to Croydon. The extra tram services will mean that passengers will not have to wait as long and will see less crowding on their route.",
     "Nick Brown, Managing Director London Underground and Rail, said: `The tram network is vital to the community it serves and we're committed to making improvements to serve the growing number of passengers who use the service.  Next year, new trams will mean customers will receive a better, more frequent service between Wimbledon and West Croydon.  We're also making journeys more reliable, providing more frequent trams during the off-peak, with brighter trams and stops and improved crossings, which will make a real difference to the customers who use the service every day.'",
     "Stephen Hammond, MP for Wimbledon, said: `The new tram platform at Wimbledon station is the latest of a growing list of local transport improvements. The increased frequency of services will make more jobs and opportunities available to local people and also help attract more business and investment into Wimbledon itself.'",
     "Tram services had been stopping at Dundonald Road while the work took place. Trams are now running on the entire route between Wimbledon and West Croydon.",
     "The tram network has experienced rapid growth in passenger numbers since it opened in 2000, from 18.5 million passengers in its first year of operation to over 32 million in 2014/15, and demand on the tram network is forecast to increase to around 60 million by 2030.",
     "A number of improvements have already been made, including additional track between Mitcham Junction and Beddington Lane which allows trams to travel in both directions simultaneously allowing for more frequent and faster journeys.",
     "The improvements will also have a positive impact on other transport services in the area, helping to relieve congestion on buses and encouraging car owners to leave their vehicles at home - reducing traffic and carbon emissions.",
