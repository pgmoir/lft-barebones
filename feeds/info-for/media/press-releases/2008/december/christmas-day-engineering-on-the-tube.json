     "Howard Collins, Chief Operating Officer of LU, said: 'Christmas Day is the only day of the year when there are no Tube services in operation, so we're making the most of this time to test our new trains and signals keeping passenger disruption to a minimum.'",

This will see the upgrading and expansion of CCTV facilities from analogue to digital and the recording of high quality images to hard drive rather than magnetic tape. This will ultimately mean that no one will be able to enter the Underground/DLR network without their face being recorded by CCTV camera. CCTV coverage also extends to trains and will be expanded as new rolling stock arrives on the network. Footage from CCTV cameras is not only able to viewed and monitored locally by a specific station but can also be accessed remotely by the LU's Network Operation Centre and by the British Transport Police. This does not cover all stations\",\"Tube Lines is responsible for the maintenance and upgrade of the infrastructure on the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines. LU is responsible for operating the Underground, for employing drivers and station staff, for ticketing and fares, and for the Tube's safety\",\"Metronet Rail BCV and SSL are now under the control of London Underground to ensure all necessary maintenance and renewal works continue\"]}"
