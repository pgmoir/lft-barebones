     "A good transport system is essential to improving quality of life",
     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, today outlined his plan for the future of London's transport system as he launched TfL's multi-billion pound 10-year Business Plan.",
     "The Plan, which will help deliver an almost 30 per cent increase in the Capital's transport network by 2018, includes massive transport improvements in Southeast London including Crossrail, acceptance of Oyster pay as you go on National Rail, the extension of London Overground, the expansion of the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), measures to smooth traffic flow for road users and a huge investment to begin a revolution in cycling and walking.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Tough decisions\"}",
     "However, these are challenging economic times and follow a legacy of over promise which has led to the Mayor being required to make some tough decisions about projects that had been promised but which never had any money set aside for their delivery.",
     "This means that tram schemes with much merit, such as the Cross River Tram, will have to be re-assessed.",
     "Given pressures on TfL funding and concerns over local traffic impacts, the Mayor today confirmed that TfL will no longer be pursuing the proposed Thames Gateway Bridge.",
     "The Mayor said: 'A good transport system is essential to improving quality of life, as the more time Londoners spend shoehorned onto trains, Tube carriages or buses, the less time they have to themselves or to spend with their families.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Brunelian endeavour\"}",
     "'So we have to build a better system, and in this important moment for our city we are committing to building our transport infrastructure with Brunelian endeavour and scale, investing billions to create a network that Londoners will recognise as vastly improved from the one we have now.",
     "'We will upgrade the Tube, build Crossrail, capture the legacy of the 2012 Games, and create thousands of jobs, helping to boost the capacity of our public transport network by almost 30 per cent.",
     "'Smoothing traffic flows will help get the most from our road system.",
     "'And we will both revolutionise cycling and walking, and sustain investment in transport policing so that we deliver not only a bigger and better network, but also a safer one - making London an even better place to live.'",
     "The transport improvements for Southeast London in the TfL Business Plan include:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"\\u003cstrong\\u003eLondon Underground \\u003c/strong\\u003e - Completion of the Jubilee line upgrade by the end of 2009 which will deliver a further 33 per cent increase in capacity benefiting Londoners living in Southwark and Bermondsey\",\"\\u003cstrong\\u003eCrossrail \\u003c/strong\\u003e - construction will begin in 2010, greatly improving transport services for those living in Southeast London when it opens in 2017, as it will relieve congestion on existing Tube and National Rail services. Crossrail will be the largest addition to the transport network in London and the South East for more than 50 years, running 118km from Maidenhead in the west through central London to Abbey Wood and Shenfield in the east\",\"\\u003cstrong\\u003eLondon Overground \\u003c/strong\\u003e - the extended East London line will re-open as part of the new London Overground network connecting Highbury \\u0026 Islington to Crystal Palace and West Croydon in 2010 along with a fleet of brand new trains. The Mayor and TfL are also continuing discussions with the Department for Transport over funding to extending the East London line to Clapham Junction from Surrey Quays\",\"\\u003cstrong\\u003eGreenwich Waterfront Transit \\u003c/strong\\u003e - Opening in 2009, subject to planning approval, will be a high frequency bus service from North Greenwich to Abbey Wood via Woolwich and Thamesmead\",\"\\u003cstrong\\u003eDocklands Light Railway \\u003c/strong\\u003e - the majority of the network is being upgraded to allow the operation of longer 3-car trains which will add 50 per cent extra capacity. The new extension to Woolwich Arsenal, due to open in February 2009, will provide a much needed additional new river crossing.\",\"\\u003cstrong\\u003eOyster pay as you go on National Rail \\u003c/strong\\u003e - the Mayor and TfL are aiming to ensure that Oyster pay as you go is available on all National Rail services in London by late 2009, a major boost to those living in Southeast London who are heavily reliant on national rail for journeys into central London\",\"\\u003cstrong\\u003eTramlink \\u003c/strong\\u003e - The Tramlink network, now owned and managed by TfL, which connects Beckenham Junction, Elmers End and New Addington with Croydon and South West London will also benefit from improvements.

     "The Mayor today underlined the importance of continued high-level investment in transport infrastructure to create thousands of jobs for Londoners, boost the economy through uncertain times, and ensure London retains its pre-eminent global position.",
     "But he also outlined how the uncertain economic climate means that tough choices need to be made and that a new approach of realism needs to be applied to prospective projects.",
     "The Mayor recognises, now more than ever, that TfL must make efficiencies and spend public money wisely given that Londoners are watching their outgoings in these challenging times.",
     "In a departure from the old administration, the Mayor has instructed TfL to focus on delivering on time and budget the projects that will give the greatest benefits to Londoners, and not to proceed with spending money on projects that are yet to receive the necessary funding from Government and other sources.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Sustainable transport\"}",
     "Commenting on the tough decisions required to ensure a balanced and sustainable transport plan the Mayor said: 'London is the engine of the UK economy and it is vital that we continue to invest in better transport during these tough times.",
     "'But at the same time, we need to focus on the projects that deliver real benefits for Londoners, and let go of those that lack the funding for completion.",
     "'These projects still required a total of more than £3bn in funding from the Government or other sources.",
     "'At a time when Londoners are struggling it is our duty to get maximum bang for their buck and invest in fully funded schemes that we know can be delivered.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Improving capacity\"}",
     "'I will not continue with the former Mayor's unrealistic and hollow promises.",
     "'The last administration's commitments amounted to billions of pounds worth of schemes that London could simply never afford.",
     "'Given pressures on TfL funding and concerns over local traffic impacts, TfL will no longer be pursuing the proposed Thames Gateway Bridge.",
     "'It has become clear to me that it is highly unlikely the scheme will ever truly be acceptable to all those affected and it is right that the £90m we are currently spending on it be re-directed.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Bus improvements\"}",
     "'This also means that tram schemes with much merit, such as the Cross River Tram will have to be re-assessed.",
     "'The Cross River Tram is not funded and I believe the £19m we are due to spend on its development would be better spent on improving existing public transport capacity.",
     "'So on top of the existing transport improvements for Southeast London in the plan, I have asked TfL to look at alternatives to the Cross River Tram, including the potential separation of the Northern line and improvements to bus services.'",
     "Transport Commissioner Peter Hendy said: 'The Mayor has set out his vision for the future and TfL's task is to deliver on time and on budget.",
     "'I am confident we will.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Key projects\"}",
     "'Alongside this massive investment is the need to deliver clear value for money for London's taxpayers and farepayers, to maximise the cost efficiency of TfL enabling fares to be kept affordable over the longer term.",
     "'TfL has responded to this challenge by identifying £2.4bn in savings and efficiencies that we have built into our funding calculations and will use to help deliver key projects such as improving the Tube, expanding London Overground and enabling the construction of Crossrail.",
     "'And we will continue to look for more savings including through a major review of London's bus network.'",
