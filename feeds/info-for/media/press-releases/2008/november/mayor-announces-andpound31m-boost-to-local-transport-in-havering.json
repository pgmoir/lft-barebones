     "The Mayor of London Boris Johnson today announced £3.1m of funding from Transport for London (TfL) for Havering to deliver local transport improvements during the financial year 2009/10.",
     "As well as increasing next year's local transport funding from TfL - up to £168.3m from £161m in 2008/09 - the Mayor also confirmed that London's boroughs will have greater freedom in choosing local transport projects.",
     "TfL has included £100,000 for the borough council to spend locally on transport as it chooses.",
     "The £3.1m package will allow the borough to finance several schemes to improve local transport for residents including:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"£262,000 for the implementation of the Romford Station access scheme which will see the delivery of safer pedestrian crossings in the vicinity of the Railway station and adjacent bus stops. Residents will also benefit from a safer environment thanks to the installation of better lighting and CCTV, more accessible marked routes to the station and cycle parking\",\"£150,000 for the enhancement and upgrade of Hornchurch town centre which will provide local residents with new lighting, paving and accessible crossing points. All clutter will be removed. In the interest of safety and security, improvements will be made to the alleyways and the 'nooks and crannies' will be removed\",\"£137,000 for the renewal of the carriageways and footways of Lambs Lane to Upminster Road North which are currently in poor condition and will be renewed to correct any uneven surface, potholes and cracks. Pedestrians and vehicles will benefit from smooth, defect-free roads resulting in safer journeys in the boroughs\",\"£60,000 for cycle training and £20,000 for cycle racks in Romford\",\"£50,000 to create a pedestrian phase at Doggett's Corner junction. The site is near community facilities, bus stops and Havering 6th Form College and therefore has high pedestrian demand and a need for safer crossing. Tactile paving will also be added\"]}",
