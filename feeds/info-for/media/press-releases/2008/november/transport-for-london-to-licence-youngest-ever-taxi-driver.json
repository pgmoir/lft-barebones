     "Kevin MacLaren broke his older brother's record after completing and passing the Knowledge this month at Transport for London's (TfL's) Public Carriage Office.",
     "Kevin is not legally allowed to be licensed as a taxi driver until he turns 21 so will have to wait until 11 November 2010 to be presented with his All-London 'green badge', allowing him to work throughout Greater London.",
     "His brother Casey, who was the previous record holder, passed his Knowledge at the age of 20 and was licensed in March this year when he turned 21.",
     "Kevin and Casey live in Putney with their parents, who are both taxi drivers.",
     "On average, it takes three to four years to successfully pass the Knowledge and become an All-London taxi driver but Kevin completed his studies in less than two years.",
     "Kevin MacLaren said: 'My brother took just over two years to complete the Knowledge and I would never have heard the end of it if I took longer.",
     "'I've always wanted to be a cabbie - I like the flexibility of setting your own hours and being your own boss.'",
     "TfL's Director of Taxi and Private Hire, Ed Thompson, said: 'It gives us so much pleasure to see young people choosing taxi driving as a career.",
     "'We hope many continue to take on the challenge that is the Knowledge, getting to know London inside out to provide what we feel is the best taxi service in the world.",
     "'I hope Kevin has a long and successful career ahead of him.'",
     "Kevin currently plays football with his brother for Hendon FC and has been boxing since he was nine years old.",
     "He also teaches two days a week at the Paddington Knowledge School.",
     "To keep his Knowledge of London skills up-to-date, he regularly gets back on his Moped, but is looking forward to getting behind the wheel of a taxi as soon as he turns 21.",
