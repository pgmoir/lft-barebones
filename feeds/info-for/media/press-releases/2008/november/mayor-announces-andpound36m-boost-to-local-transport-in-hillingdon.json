     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, today announced £3.6m of funding from Transport for London (TfL) for Hillingdon to deliver local transport improvements during the financial year 2009/10.",
     "As well as increasing next year's local transport funding from TfL - up to £168.3m from £161m in 2008/09 - the Mayor also confirmed that London's boroughs will have greater freedom in choosing local transport projects.",
     "TfL has included £100,000 for the borough council to spend locally on transport as it chooses.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe £3.6m package will allow the borough to finance several schemes to improve local transport for residents including:",

This will increase awareness of community safety and therefore increase footfall to major trip attractors. The audits will inform future pedestrian improvement programmes to encourage greater levels of walking\",\"£15,000 for the provision of school signage, road lining and fencing at a number of schools across the borough in association with School Travel Plans produced in 2008-09. These measures warn drivers to drive carefully outside schools, creating a safer environment for pedestrians, particularly schoolchildren, and other road users\"]}",

     "'This is why this year I have introduced a £100,000 award for Boroughs to spend as they choose.",
