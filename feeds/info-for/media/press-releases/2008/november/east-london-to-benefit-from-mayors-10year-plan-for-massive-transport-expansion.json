     "A good transport system is essential to improving quality of life",
     "The Mayor of London Boris Johnson today outlined his plan for the future of London's transport system as he launched Transport for London's multi-billion pound 10-year Business Plan.",
     "The Plan, which will help deliver an almost 30 per cent increase in the Capital's public transport network by 2018, includes massive transport improvements in East London including Crossrail, the upgrades of the Circle, District, Jubilee and Hammersmith \u0026 City lines, the extension of London Overground, the expansion of the DLR, measures to smooth traffic flow for road users and a huge investment to begin a revolution in cycling and walking.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Tough decisions\"}",
     "However the Mayor made clear that the current challenging economic times follow the former Mayor's promises of schemes for which there was never any money, ultimately leading to some tough decisions about which projects the Plan will fund.",
     "Given pressures on TfL funding and concerns over local traffic impacts, the Mayor today confirmed that TfL will no longer be pursuing the proposed Thames Gateway Bridge.",
     "The DLR Extension to Dagenham Dock will not be progressed at this time as no Government funding for construction is currently available.",
     "The Mayor said: 'A good transport system is essential to improving quality of life, as the more time Londoners spend shoehorned onto trains, Tube carriages or buses, the less time they have to themselves or to spend with their families.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Brunelian endeavour\"}",
     "'So we have to build a better system, and in this important moment for our city we are committing to building our transport infrastructure with Brunelian endeavour and scale, investing billions to create a network that Londoners will recognise as vastly improved from the one we have now.",
     "'We will upgrade the Tube, build Crossrail, capture the legacy of the 2012 Games, and create thousands of jobs, helping to boost the capacity of our public transport network by almost 30 per cent.",
     "'Smoothing traffic flows will help get the most from our road system.",
     "'And we will both revolutionise cycling and walking, and sustain investment in transport policing so that we deliver not only a bigger and better network, but also a safer one - making London an even better place to live.'",
     "The transport improvements for East London in the TfL Business Plan include:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"\\u003cstrong\\u003eLondon Underground \\u003c/strong\\u003e - Completion of the Jubilee line upgrade by end of 2009, which will deliver a further 33 per cent increase in capacity. The District and Hammersmith \\u0026 City lines will also be upgraded to provide additional capacity and new rolling stock with air conditioning will be introduced on these lines. The signalling system will also be upgraded to allow the operation of faster, more frequent services across the sub-surface network - the Circle, District, Hammersmith \\u0026 City and Metropolitan lines\",\"\\u003cstrong\\u003eCrossrail \\u003c/strong\\u003e - construction will begin in 2010, greatly improving transport services for those living in East London when it opens in 2017. Crossrail will be the largest addition to the transport network in London and the South East for more than 50 years, running 118km from Maidenhead in the west through central London to Abbey Wood and Shenfield in the east\",\"\\u003cstrong\\u003eLondon Overground \\u003c/strong\\u003e - the extended East London line will re-open as part of the new London Overground network connecting Highbury \\u0026 Islington to Crystal Palace and West Croydon in 2010 along with a fleet of brand new trains. The extension from Surrey Quays to Clapham Junction is currently unfunded. Aware of the benefits that a further extension would bring to South West London, the Mayor and TfL are continuing discussions with the Department for Transport\",\"\\u003cstrong\\u003eEast London Transit \\u003c/strong\\u003e - Next year will see the construction and opening of the East London Transit, a high frequency bus service from Ilford to Dagenham Dock via Barking Town Centre. The transit will connect local town centres, regeneration areas and Interchanges with London Underground, rail services and existing bus networks\",\"\\u003cstrong\\u003eDocklands Light Railway \\u003c/strong\\u003e - the majority of the network is being upgraded to allow the operation of longer three-car trains which will add 50 per cent extra capacity.

     "The Mayor today underlined the importance of continued high-level investment in transport infrastructure to create thousands of jobs for Londoners, boost the economy through uncertain times, and ensure London retains its pre-eminent global position.",
     "But he also outlined how the uncertain economic climate means that tough choices need to be made and that a new approach of realism needs to be applied to prospective projects.",
     "The Mayor recognises now more than ever, that TfL must make efficiencies and spend public money wisely given that Londoners are watching their outgoings in these challenging times.",
     "In a departure from the old administration, the Mayor has instructed TfL to focus on delivering on time and budget the projects that will give the greatest benefits to Londoners, and not to proceed with spending money on projects that are yet to receive the necessary funding from Government and other sources.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Traffic impacts\"}",
     "Commenting on the tough decisions required to ensure a balanced and sustainable transport plan the Mayor said: 'London is the engine of the UK economy and it is vital that we continue to invest in better transport during these tough times.",
     "'But at the same time, we need to focus on the projects that deliver real benefits for Londoners, and let go of those that lack the funding for completion.",
     "'These projects still required a total of over £3bn in funding from the Government or other sources.",
     "'At a time when Londoners are struggling it is our duty to get maximum bang for their buck and invest in fully funded schemes that we know can be delivered.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Challenge\"}",
     "'I will not continue with the former Mayor's unrealistic and hollow promises.",
     "'The last administration's commitments amounted to billions of pounds worth of schemes that London could simply never afford.",
     "'Given pressures on TfL funding and concerns over local traffic impacts, TfL will no longer be pursuing the proposed Thames Gateway Bridge.",
     "'It has become clear to me that it is highly unlikely the scheme will ever truly be acceptable to all those affected and it is right that the £90m we are currently spending on it be re-directed.'",
     "Transport Commissioner Peter Hendy said: 'The Mayor has set out his vision for the future and TfL's task is to deliver on time and on budget. I am confident we will.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Major review\"}",
     "'Alongside this massive investment is the need to deliver clear value for money for London's taxpayers and farepayers, to maximise the cost efficiency of TfL enabling fares to be kept affordable over the longer term.",
     "'TfL has responded to this challenge by identifying £2.4bn in savings and efficiencies that we have built into our funding calculations and will use to help deliver key projects such as improving the Tube, expanding London Overground and enabling the construction of Crossrail.",
     "'And we will continue to look for more savings including through a major review of London's bus network.'",
