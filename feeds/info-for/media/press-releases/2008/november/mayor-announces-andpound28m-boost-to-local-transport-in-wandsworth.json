     "The Mayor of London Boris Johnson today announced £2.8m of funding from Transport for London (TfL) for Wandsworth to deliver local transport improvements during the financial year 2009/10.",
     "As well as increasing next year's local transport funding from TfL - up to £168.3m from £161m in 2008/09 - the Mayor also confirmed that London's boroughs will have greater freedom in choosing local transport projects.",
     "TfL has included £100,000 for the borough council to spend locally on transport as it chooses.",
     "The £2.8m package will allow the borough to finance several schemes to improve local transport for residents including:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"£200,000 for a 20mph scheme in the Dover House Road and West Putney area. Measures will include entry treatments and road narrowing to reduce road collisions, excess speed and rat-running\",\"£100,000 for the implementation of diagonal pedestrian crossing outside Southfields District line Station. This scheme will improve accessibility and journey time to the station and help complement the proposed provision of a lift within the station, adding value to existing TfL spend. At peak times on an average weekday, some 2,800 people enter and exit the station per hour and a total of 5m users per year. They are subject to delay and inconvenience, as it is not possible to make the most direct crossing movement. A diversionary route taking in two arms of the junction must be taken instead, and this leads to pedestrian congestion on the corners of the junction\",\"£100,000 for the implementation of school travel plans at Burntwood School and Ernest Bevan College. Measures will include a crossing facility and cycling provision on Burntwood Lane\",\"£60,000 for cycle training, £20,000 for residential cycle parking and £8,000 for cycle parking in public places\",\"£15,000 to help fund the installation of two Electrical Recharging Points in the borough. They will provide an alternative energy source which aims to improve local air quality for businesses, residents, visitors and fleet operators by assisting in reducing CO2 emissions\"]}",
