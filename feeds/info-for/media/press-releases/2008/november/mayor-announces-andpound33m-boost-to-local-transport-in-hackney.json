     "As well as increasing next year's local transport funding from TfL - up to £168.3m from £161m in 2008/09 - the Mayor also confirmed that London's boroughs will have greater freedom in choosing local transport projects.",
     "TfL has included £100,000 for the borough council to spend locally on transport as it chooses.",

Wider footways will be installed as well as new lighting, trees and pedestrian facilities\",\"£238,000 for the renewal of the carriageways and footways of Green Lanes which are known to be currently in poor condition and will be renewed to correct any uneven surface, potholes and cracks. Pedestrians and vehicles will benefit from smooth, defect-free roads resulting in safer journeys in the boroughs\",\"£200,000 for the Hackney Cycle Training Programme which aims to provide an ethnically diverse population with the skills and confidence to cycle in London thus making cycling easier and safer for those who take part in the scheme. Cycle training in Hackney is outsourced to STA bikes who won an award at the Community Cycling Awards in 2007 for their innovation and excellence. In 2007/08 through LIP funding Hackney trained over 1100 children and 350 adults\",\"£100,000 to improve key walking routes between Hackney Central and London Fields.  Measures will include footway surface improvements, new crossings and safety and security enhancements where necessary.  These works will encourage more people to take up walking by reducing the impact of traffic and creating more direct routes\",\"£45,000 to improve cycling provision in the Downs Lane/Tiger Way and Downs Lane/Downs Road areas\"]}",
