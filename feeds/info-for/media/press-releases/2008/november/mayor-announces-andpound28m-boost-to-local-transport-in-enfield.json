     "The Mayor of London Boris Johnson today announced £2.8m of funding from Transport for London (TfL) for Enfield to deliver local transport improvements during the financial year 2009/10.",
     "This represents an approximate 20 per cent increase on the £2.3m received last year.",
     "As well as increasing next year's local transport funding from TfL - up to £168.3m from £161m in 2008/09 - the Mayor also confirmed that London's boroughs will have greater freedom in choosing local transport projects.",
     "TfL has included £100,000 for the borough council to spend locally on transport as it chooses.",
     "The £2.7m package will allow the borough to finance several schemes to improve local transport for residents including:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"£750,000 for the renewal of the carriageways and footways of the A110 Church Street and the A1005, The Ridgeway, which are currently in poor condition and which will be renewed to correct any uneven surface, potholes and cracks. Pedestrians and vehicles will benefit from smooth, defect-free roads resulting in safer journeys in the boroughs\",\"£200,000 for the implementation of a 20mph speed limit which will be applied on Salisbury School on a part time basis. Additional signing and road markings will be installed. These measures aim to reduce motorists' speed on this section of the road which has seen five casualties in a three year period thus cutting the number of road deaths and accidents, making it safer for residents\",\"£150,000 towards a key walking route in Enfield town centre.  Measures to improve the environment for pedestrians include an improved footpath surface, better crossings and rationalised street furniture. The town centre will also benefit from better lighting and enhanced 'rights of way signage'\",\"£60,000 for cycle training including a cycle co-ordinator and a further £40,000 for cycle leisure routes.\"]}",
