     "A new focus on value for money means £2.4bn in efficiency savings can help deliver key projects.",
     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, today outlined his plan for the future of London's transport system as he launched TfL's multi-billion pound 10-year Business Plan.",
     "The Mayor and Transport Commissioner Peter Hendy set out the detail of a huge Investment Programme that will help deliver an almost 30 per cent increase in the Capital's transport network by 2018.",
     "The Programme will focus on the upgrade of the Tube, building Crossrail, extensions to the DLR and London Overground networks, supporting the 2012 Games and securing a legacy from them, smoothing traffic flows, leading a revolution in cycling and walking, and providing greater flexibility for London's boroughs to deliver local transport solutions.",
     "The Mayor underlined the importance of continued and massive investment in transport infrastructure to create thousands of jobs for Londoners, boost the economy through uncertain times, and ensure London retains its pre-eminent global position.",
     "But he also outlined how the economic climate means that tough choices need to be made and that a new approach of realism needs to be applied to prospective projects.",
     "In a departure from the old administration, the Mayor has instructed TfL to focus on delivering the projects that will give the greatest benefits to Londoners, and not to proceed with spending money on projects that are yet to receive the necessary funding from Government and other sources.",
     "The Mayor said: 'A good transport system is essential to improving quality of life, as the more time Londoners spend shoehorned onto trains, Tube carriages or buses, the less time they have to themselves or to spend with their families.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e'So we have to build a better system, and in this important moment for our city we are committing to building our transport infrastructure with Brunelian endeavour and scale, investing billions to create a network that Londoners will recognise as vastly improved from the one we have now.",
     "'We will upgrade the Tube, build Crossrail, capture the legacy of the 2012 Games, and create thousands of jobs, helping to boost the capacity of our public transport network by almost 30 per cent.",
     "'Smoothing traffic flows will help get the most from our road system.",
     "'And we will both revolutionise cycling and walking, and sustain investment in transport policing so that we deliver not only a bigger and better network, but also a safer one - making London an even better place to live.'",
     "The Mayor's transport priorities set out in TfL's 10-year Business Plan are:",
     "To expand public transport capacity:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Completing the transformation of the Tube, including new air-conditioned trains, improved reliability and faster journeys, and building Crossrail, the single largest transport project seen in the UK in generations, that on its own will provide an extra 10 per cent capacity to the rail-based public transport network\",\"To smooth traffic flows: making the best use of London's limited road space by re-phasing traffic lights and tackling the disruption caused by unplanned roadworks\",\"To lead a revolution in cycling and walking in London: facilitating a step change increase in the numbers of people travelling by these most environmentally friendly and health enhancing modes\",\"To deliver London's 2012 transport projects and secure a lasting legacy: completing the East London line extension to the London Overground network and increasing capacity on an extended DLR\",\"To improve further the safety and security of the travelling public: building on the massively increased numbers of uniformed officers patrolling the buses and Tube and innovative new methods, such as trialling live CCTV on buses\",\"To dramatically improve the experience of travelling in London: through, for example, the development and further roll-out to National Rail of the Oyster card, giving passengers better information, making buses safer, improving the urban realm, and introducing a 21st Century Routemaster bus\"]}",
     "Commenting on the tough decisions required to ensure a balanced and sustainable transport plan, the Mayor said: 'London is the engine of the UK economy and it is vital that we continue to invest in better transport during these tough times.",
     "'But at the same time, we need to focus on the projects that deliver real benefits for Londoners, and let go of those that lack the funding for completion.",
     "'These projects still required a total of over £3bn in funding from the Government or other sources.",
     "'At a time when Londoners are struggling it is our duty to get maximum bang for their buck and invest in fully funded schemes that we know can be delivered.",
     "'I will not continue with the former Mayor's unrealistic and hollow promises.",
     "'The last administration's commitments amounted to billions of pounds worth of schemes that London could simply never afford.'",
     "Transport Commissioner Peter Hendy said: 'The Mayor has set out his vision for the future and TfL's task is to deliver on time and on budget.",
     "'I am confident we will.",
     "'Alongside this massive investment is the need to deliver clear value for money for London's taxpayers and farepayers, to maximise the cost efficiency of TfL enabling fares to be kept affordable over the longer term.",
     "'TfL has responded to this challenge by identifying £2.4bn in savings and efficiencies that we have built into our funding calculations and will use to help deliver key projects such as improving the Tube, expanding London Overground and enabling the construction of Crossrail.",
     "'And we will continue to look for more savings including through a major review of London's bus network.'",
     "Funding for the programme outlined in the Business Plan is based on TfL's 10-year, £39bn financial settlement with Government.",

     "Achievements of the Plan:",

     "However the Business Plan will deliver a number of transport improvements to the communities along the proposed routes including the increased capacity and more frequent services to come on the Northern, Victoria and Piccadilly lines.",
     "TfL and the London Devlopment Agency will now look at alternatives to Cross River Tram including Northern line separation, improved bus operations and other ways of supporting local regeneration.",
