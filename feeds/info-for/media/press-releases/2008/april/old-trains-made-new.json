     "The District line carries more than 600,000 customers every weekday and the refurbishment programme, which began in 2003, has been an important step towards improving and expanding the Tube as part of the programme.",
     "All of the 75 District line trains have been fitted with completely renewed interiors, CCTV cameras inside the cars, fire retardant seats and flooring; and accessibility measures, including tip-up seats to accommodate wheelchairs, buggies and luggage.",

     "The renewal of the District line fleet was part of a refurbishment programme carried out by Metronet Rail.",
     "Bob Thorogood, District line General Manager, said: 'These District line trains have served Londoners since 1980 and proved a reliable part of the transport network.",
     "'The refurbishment of the fleet has brought a higher standard of accessibility with improved announcement systems, extra space for wheelchairs, prams and luggage, as well as additional security measures such as in car CCTV.",
     "'The refurbished trains are popular with our customers, some of whom think they are brand new trains.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Delivered\"}",
     "Metronet's Chief Executive, Andie Harper, said: 'I am very proud of the Metronet team that has delivered this well under budget and 11 months early - that has to be good news for the half a million people using the District line every day.",
     "'These 30 year old trains presented us with many technical challenges but their transformation speaks volumes and is a credit to the refurbishment team at Bombardier in Derby.'",
     "Each District line train has travelled an estimated three million kilometres since entering service from 1980.",
     "The refurbished trains will help extend the life of the trains until the introduction of a new fleet of trains in 2013.",
