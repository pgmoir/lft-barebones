     "On the advice of the Energy Saving Trust (EST), TfL's Public Carriage Office (PCO) decided on Friday 28 March to withdraw the approval granted on 11 September 2007 for the modified Eco-Power emissions reduction system (which recirculates exhaust gases into the vehicle's exhaust pipe via a heat exchanger, rather than through the vehicle's engine).",
     "Following a conformity inspection carried out by EST, the PCO was advised that the modified system did not meet the technical requirements for reducing emissions of oxides of nitrogen.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Flawed\"}",
     "A PCO notice was issued on Friday 28 March providing advice for taxi owners who had already installed the system or had appointments to have it installed.",
     "The PCO wanted to prevent taxi owners fitting a system that they believed may be flawed.",
     "However, Eco-Power obtained an injunction from the High Court on 30 March preventing the PCO from publishing notice of the withdrawal of the approval.",
     "In the High Court yesterday (Tuesday 22Â April ), Judge Hickinbottom discharged that injunction and dismissed Eco-Power's challenge to the PCO's decision to withdraw the authorisation in respect of the modified system.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Expert advice\"}",
     "The judge held that, in doing so, the PCO had acted reasonably on the basis of proper expert advice.",
     "The High Court confirmed that PCO approvals for Eco-Power's original system (which recirculates exhaust gases directly into the vehicle's engine) remain unaffected.",
     "The PCO has no objection to this original system being fitted.",
     "Ed Thompson, TfL's Taxis and Private Hire Director, said: 'Our concern throughout has been to ensure that our high standards of emissions reduction technology are maintained.",
     "'The PCO is pleased with this outcome and fully takes on board the judge's detailed and careful consideration of this case.'",
