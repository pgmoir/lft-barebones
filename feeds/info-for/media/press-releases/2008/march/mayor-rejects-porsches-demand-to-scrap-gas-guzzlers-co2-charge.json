     "Porsche should focus on cutting CO2 emissions from their cars rather than pursuing pointless legal action",
     "Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone and Transport for London (TfL) today rejected a demand by luxury and sports car manufacturer Porsche to scrap plans for a higher £25 Congestion Charge for the very highest CO2 emitting cars, including many of the so-called Chelsea Tractors, the most powerful sports cars and some luxury executive cars, as part of the Capital's plans to tackle climate change and cut congestion.",
     "Porsche demanded the Mayor scrap plans for the higher £25 charge, or they would seek a judicial review for the decision to be overturned by the courts.",
     "In a letter sent today (March 10) to Porsche setting out why their objections are unfounded, the Mayor and TfL made clear that:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"The CO2 Charge is about reducing CO2 emissions from cars driving in central London, whilst reducing congestion, as part of the Mayor's Transport Strategy and Climate Change Action Plan\",\"It is quite clear motorists have the choice not to drive a high CO2 emitting, car in central London, given the wide range of lower emitting cars available.\",\"Along with the higher £25 charge for the cars emitting the most CO2, there will be a 100 per cent discount for the least emitting.\"]}",

     "The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, said:",
     "\"Porsche have a clear vested interest in attempting to block this ground breaking scheme, against the interests of Londoners as a whole.",
     "They should focus their attentions on cutting CO2 emissions from the cars they produce, rather than pursuing this pointless legal action which we will vigorously contest.",
     "We have already seen several motor manufacturers rise to the challenge of cutting CO2 emissions from their cars and Porsche should join them.",
     "\"While the purpose of the CO2 Charge is not to raise revenue, we anticipate it will also raise around £30-50 million in revenue each year to begin with.",
     "This money will be reinvested in transport improvements across the capital, including my plans to improve facilities for people walking and cycling in London.\"",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"London better with the Congestion Charge\"}",
     "The principal aim of the scheme remains tackling congestion. Central London would be far worse without it",
     "Michèle Dix, Managing Director of Planning, TfL, said:",
     "\"The Congestion Charge scheme has been a success at cutting congestion and traffic, with around 70,000 less vehicles a day entering the original central zone.",
     "Without it congestion in central London would be far worse.",
     "\"The principal aim of the scheme remains tackling congestion.",
     "The aim of the CO2 Charge element and discount of the scheme is to cut CO2 emissions by reducing the number of very high emitting cars driving in central London, influencing people's car purchasing choices and by stimulating the market for low emissions cars.",
     "\"At the moment, 17 per cent of cars driving in the charge zone are in Band G, while just 2 per cent are in Band's A and B.",
     "We expect to see the number of Band G cars cut significantly over time.\"",
