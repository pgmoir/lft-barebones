     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Keep tyres inflated to the right pressure - for every 10 per cent your tyres are under-inflated, fuel consumption increases by around 1 per cent. The Highway Code recommends checking weekly that tyres are at the recommended pressure as stated in the owner's handbook\",\"Speed up and slow down smoothly - a typical car requires only around 10 per cent of its power to drive at a steady 30mph. The remaining 90 per cent is only used during hard acceleration or at very high speeds. Read the road ahead as far as possible and avoid unnecessary braking and accelerating\",\"Change gear at low revs - keep an eye on the rev counter and shift up between 2,000 and 2,500 rpm. This can also help reduce noise pollution - research has shown that the engine noise of one car driving with 4,000 rpm is the same as 32 cars at 2,000 rpm.\",\"Don't leave your engine running to warm it up - idling to heat the engine wastes fuel\",\"Limit the number of short car journeys you make -Repeated short trips don't give the engine enough time to warm up and therefore more fuel is used. A cold engine uses almost twice as much fuel and catalytic converters can take 6 miles to become effective. Try to combine short journeys or consider walking and cycling instead\"]}",
     "An experiment carried out by Millbrook, one of the world's leading vehicle testing organisations, to launch the campaign, found that adopting these Smarter Driving techniques can add-up to significant savings, with average savings of 26 per cent demonstrated on a circuit designed to replicate real-life driving conditions in London.",
