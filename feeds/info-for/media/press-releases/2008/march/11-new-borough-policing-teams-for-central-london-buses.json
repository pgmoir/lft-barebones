     "The safer transport teams have played a major role in reducing crime on London's buses to its lowest level since 2004.",
     "A review of the Transport Operational Command Unit, which is funded by Transport for London and operated by the Metropolitan Police, has recommended that similar teams be set up to the Safer Transport Teams that already operate successfully in the 21 outer London boroughs.",
     "Last year an extra 440 police and community support officers were deployed to the outer London boroughs in Safer Transport Teams and bus related crime fell by 11 per cent across London, between April and September last year, compared to the year before.",
     "Now new teams are to be deployed in Westminster, Camden, Hackney, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Hammersmith and Fulham, Lambeth, Southwark, Tower Hamlets, Wandsworth and Lewisham.",
     "Support will also be increased for the safer transport teams in London's outer boroughs by providing them with extra officers.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Specialist teams to combat crime\"}",
     "The review of the Transport Operational Command Unit also recommends that some functions continue to be carried out by specialist teams that will cover the whole of the Capital.",
     "These include the 'BusTag' and 'Dip' teams that specialise in combating criminal damage and pick pocketing respectively.",
     "Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of London, said: \"The safer transport teams in London's outer boroughs have played a major role in reducing crime on London's buses to its lowest level since 2004.",
     "Crime in central London is different to that in the outer boroughs and the new teams working there will tailor their work to deal with the different challenges they face.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Visible presence\"}",
     "The success of the Safer Transport Teams is testament to the effectiveness of this borough based approach.",
     "\"These teams will be highly visible on the busy buses of central London where they will provide a reassuring presence for Londoners and visitors to our city.",
     "The hard work of Transport for London and the Metropolitan Police is paying off as the bus network continues to provide an overwhelmingly safe environment.\"",
     "Steve Burton, Director of Community Safety, Enforcement and Policing said: \"We have had five years of targeted policing on the bus network, and the result is that we now have the lowest rate of crime on buses in that time.",
     "\"The success of the Safer Transport Teams in outer London is testament to the effectiveness of this borough based approach where teams of police get to know the communities they are working in, as well as the hot spots for crime and disorder.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Building strength and integration\"}",
     "The review recommends building on the strengths of both the Safer Transport Teams and the Transport Operational Command Unit by increasing their integration and strengthening their work with the British Transport Police.",
     "\"Another major benefit will be closer working with bus garages, and more joined up operations with our colleagues in the Safer Transport Teams and the British Transport Police.\"",
     "Chief Superintendent Joe Royle, of the Transport Operational Command Unit, said: \"We are pleased to have participated in this review which will deliver some exciting and innovative policing methods to further reduce crime and the fear of crime on London's bus network.\"",
