     "The programme aims to encourage people to cut their costs and their carbon emissions by making simple changes to the way that they travel. Around 20 per cent of the carbon emissions savings we can make from transport by 2025 will come from changing the way we travel.",

     "The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone said: \"Since 2000, Londoners have started to change the way that they travel, with the Capital becoming the only major world city to have achieved a shift from the use of cars toward public transport, walking and cycling.",
     "\"The improvements to public transport and the introduction of the Congestion Charge have been key to that shift, and Transport for London's Smarter Travel programmes have helped to show Londoners what can be achieved by acting locally, underpinning the message that we can all do something to tackle congestion and climate change.",
     "\"Richmond made its commitment to green travel clear when it became the first council in the country to introduce emissions related parking charges, making it the natural choice to be London's next Smarter Travel borough.\"",
     "Peter Hendy, London's Transport Commissioner said: \"Our Smarter Travel Programme works directly with people who live and work in London in their homes, their workplaces, and their children's schools, helping them move away from their dependence on the private car.",
     "By travelling by public transport, cycling or walking, they're not just choosing the greenest option - they're often also choosing the quickest, cheapest and easiest option too.\"",

     "\"We have decided to put the environment at the heart of everything we do.  For us it is not enough simply to reduce our own carbon footprint - we want to work with our various partners including TfL to set an example for others.  We are particularly proud of what is being achieved so far with our groundbreaking CO2 related parking charges.",
     "\"The significant injection of resources is going to enable us to drive forward our own green agenda - we can't wait to get going with this exciting programme.\"",

     "\"The aim of this project is to generate a critical mass of people in one area who will decide to walk more, cycle more and to switch to more sustainable forms of transport. If large numbers of people in one area make the switch, then others are more likely to follow their example.\"\u003cbr /\u003e",
