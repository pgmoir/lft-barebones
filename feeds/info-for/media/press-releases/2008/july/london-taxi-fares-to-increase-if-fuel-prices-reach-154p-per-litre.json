     "If fuel prices don't hit the 154p per litre mark before February 2009, the increased cost of fuel over the course of 2008 and the financial burden taxi drivers have faced as a result will be reflected in the April 2009 fares revision.",

The index, agreed with the taxi trade, combines changes in operating costs with national earnings to produce a change in average fares aimed at maintaining drivers' real earnings (relative to national average earnings) net of operating costs\",\"A 50p metered extra will be charged only when London retail diesel fuel prices (as measured by the Arval index) reaches the threshold level of 154 p/litre between now and 1 February 2009. If the fuel price did not reach the threshold level by 1 February 2009, the metered extra would not be authorised because any adjustment after that date would be too close to the fares revision that is due to take place in April 2009\",\"Taxi drivers are not allowed to charge more than the fare shown on the taximeter. They are allowed to add certain 'extras' to the metered fare by pressing a button on the meter that works in 50p increments. The extras that can be charged at present are for hirings booked by telephone, for journeys from Heathrow Airport and journeys on public holidays at Christmas and the New Year.\"]}"
