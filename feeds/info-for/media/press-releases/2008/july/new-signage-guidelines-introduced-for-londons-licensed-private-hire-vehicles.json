     "Ed Thompson, Director of Taxi \u0026 Private Hire at the Public Carriage Office, said: 'This measure will help PHV customers identify their booked vehicles and allow licensed operators to promote their services.",

     "'Using our Cabwise service, passengers can already get the numbers of two licensed private hire firms operating in the local area sent direct to their mobile phone, just by texting 'HOME' to 60835.",
     "'Minicabs must be booked through a licensed operator and not just taken on the street.",
     "'It is illegal for a private hire driver to carry passengers without a proper booking - the only vehicle that can be flagged down in the street is a licensed black cab.'",
     "Vehicle owners are reminded that signs are not allowed on the sides of licensed PHVs and commercial advertising on behalf of third parties is not permitted.",
