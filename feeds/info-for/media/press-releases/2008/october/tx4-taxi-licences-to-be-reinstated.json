     "This has been a really tough time for drivers, and I'm glad that we now have a solution",
     "The Public Carriage Office (PCO) today confirmed that the suspension of TX4 taxi licences will be lifted when remedial works are completed by London Taxis International (LTI).",
     "The cab licences of all TX4s with a 56 registration or a Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) between 200001 and 201000 were suspended following a number of fires involving early production models of the taxi.",
     "LTI have developed a programme of remedial works which they consider, when complete, will minimise the risk of under bonnet fires.",
     "The licence suspension will be lifted as soon as individual vehicles have been certified by LTI as having undergone the necessary modifications.",
     "LTI will be contacting all TX4 owners to arrange an appointment for them to bring in their vehicle for remedial works.",
     "They will be working 24 hours a day to process all vehicles as quickly as possible.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Finding solutions\"}",
     "Vehicles will be processed in ascending VIN order, with those cabs in the range 200001 to 201500 (which includes all TX4s with a 56 registration) being treated as a priority.",
     "Eventually all TX4s will undergo these remedial works.",
     "Ed Thompson, Director of Taxi \u0026 Private Hire at the PCO, said: 'This has been a really tough time for drivers, and I'm glad that we now have a solution.",
     "'LTI have assured me they will be working around the clock to get as many cabs back on the roads as quickly as possible.",
     "'Taxis in London have an excellent safety record.",
     "'We're satisfied that the work LTI will be carrying out will minimise any risks to drivers, passengers and other road users.'",
     "The PCO brought in an independent fire safety expert who has confirmed the remedial works proposed by LTI will significantly reduce the risk of under bonnet fires, making these vehicles acceptable for use in passenger service.",
