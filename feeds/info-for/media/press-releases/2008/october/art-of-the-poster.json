     "'The Art of the Poster: a Century of Design' features leading artists of the day, and delves into how Transport for London became a pioneering patron of poster art - a legacy which continues today.",
     "Exploring the relationship between fine artists, graphic designers and the commissioning process, the exhibition reveals the stories behind some ofÂ the artworks. Discover, for example, why the painting by world-renowned artist John Nash was never published as a poster, and find out why a controversial poster by Edward Wadsworth was withdrawn in the 1930s.",
     "Poster artworks will form the bulk of the display, supported by photographs, letters, sketches and other artists' materials.",
     "The exhibition - which runs until March 31 - will be accompanied by a lively talks and events programme, together with a new book 'London Transport Posters - a Century of Art and Design'.",
