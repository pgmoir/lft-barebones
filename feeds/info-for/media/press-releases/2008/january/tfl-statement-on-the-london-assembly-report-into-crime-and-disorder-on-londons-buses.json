     "However, the report is misleading in a number of important respects.",
     "Crime rates on London buses are in fact the lowest they have been since 2004 - and not higher than two years ago as stated.",
     "There has been an 11 per cent reduction in bus related crime, meaning that crime rates - at just 15 crimes for every million passenger journeys - are also now below levels before Free Travel for Under-16s was introduced in September 2005.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Improved reporting\"}",
     "We are confident that we will deliver a continued downward trend in the coming months and years. In fact, the vast majority of our passengers are unlikely ever to be the victim of a crime on a London bus.",
     "The report is misleading in several other areas:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"The majority of Driver Incident Reports do not relate to antisocial behaviour, and the table produced in the report of the route generating most driver calls is meaningless without taking into account the length of the route and the number of passengers who use that route\",\"The calculations made by the Assembly on the investment in security on the Docklands Light Railway do not make sense and show a total misunderstanding of the complex nature of policing London's vast transport network\",\"While the report recognises efforts to improve reporting of bus-related crime it fails to acknowledge the impact this has had. As more police and resources are employed, reporting has improved significantly. These statistics can then only be judged in the context of this concerted drive to increase reporting, particularly of graffiti and vandalism offences, which accounts for 45 per cent of the increase in total reported crime between 2004/05 and 2006/07\"]}",
     "Jeroen Weimar, Director of Transport Policing and Enforcement at TfL, said: \"Crime on London's buses is low and getting lower - there has been an 11 per cent reduction in crime levels and there are now just 15 crimes for every million passenger journeys on the bus network.",
     "\"While the report recognises that buses are a low crime environment, there are a number of conclusions that have been drawn incorrectly.",
     "\"The majority of the recommendations made by the Assembly reflect work which TfL is already doing - for example our bus drivers are already trained in conflict management, and from September all bus drivers will have to refresh their training on an annual basis.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Increased police numbers\"}",
     "\"TfL has installed CCTV on every London bus. There are now around 60,000 cameras on the fleet of 8,000 buses.",
     "\"But we are also already looking at ways to further improve the system - particularly in light of the rollout of the new iBus system over the next two years.\"",
     "The reduction in crime levels is the result of targeted and highly visible policing through improved intelligence gathering and increased police numbers.",
     "There are an extra 440 police and community support officers on the buses whose work compliments that of the existing 1,200-strong Transport Operational Command Unit.",
     "As well as CCTV on every bus, there is also instant radio connection for every bus driver to police support.",
     "This and other measures will ensure that the bus network continues to provide an overwhelmingly safe environment.",
