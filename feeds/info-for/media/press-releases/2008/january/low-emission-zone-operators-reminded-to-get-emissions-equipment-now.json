     "It is very encouraging to see that large numbers of operators are taking action",
     "With the start of the Low Emission Zone on 4 February, Transport for London (TfL) today reminded operators with vehicles that don't meet Low Emission Zone standards to make sure that they have taken all reasonable steps to comply, for example, by fitting their vehicles with emissions abatement equipment.",
     "Many operators have already fitted abatement equipment to ensure that their vehicles comply with the scheme, designed to improve London's air quality by encouraging operators to clean up the most polluting vehicles.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSome operators are taking action to do so but, because of the installation time, may not be compliant when the zone goes live.",
     "Given this situation, TfL is giving operators who drive in the zone with vehicles that do not comply, a 28 day warning period in which to bring their vehicles into compliance.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Action\"}",
     "During this time they will not be fined, but after 28 days penalty charge notices will be issued and it will be up to the operator to show that they have made all reasonable progress before the introduction of the zone.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNick Fairholme, Head of the London Low Emission Zone, said: \"It is very encouraging to see that large numbers of operators are taking action to make their vehicles compliant with the Low Emission Zone standards.",
     "\"We always planned to issue only warning letters to operators of non-compliant vehicles the first time they are seen within the zone.",
     "\"This strikes a fair balance between ensuring the benefits are delivered while giving those operators who are taking steps to meet the emissions standards a warning and the opportunity to comply.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Reducing pollution\"}",
     "\"We are making the warning letter and the 28 day period known to operators now, particularly those who have sought to take action in the period up to 4 February, and are concerned that they are waiting on delivery of new vehicles or to have abatement equipment fitted.\"\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe London Low Emission Zone aims to reduce traffic pollution caused by large diesel vehicles and improve the health and quality of life of Londoners.",

     "All diesel-engined vehicles between 3.5 and 12 tonnes, buses and coaches will be affected by the Low Emission Zone from 7 July 2008.\u003cbr /\u003e",

However, if operators can demonstrate they have sought to comply with the emissions standards, eg through placing an order for an abatement device or a new vehicle in good time, then they can apply to TfL for a refund of the daily charges paid, provided they can supply appropriate evidence\"]}"
