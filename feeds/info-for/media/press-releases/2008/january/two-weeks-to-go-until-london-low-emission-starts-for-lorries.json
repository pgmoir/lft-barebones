     "The capital has the worst air pollution in the UK, and among the worst in Europe, and polling has found that 72 per cent of Londoners are worried about pollution from traffic exhaust fumes.",
     "Poor air quality worsens asthma and causes the premature death of an estimated 1,000 people each year in London.",

     "TfL has carried out an extensive operator information campaign, which began in June 2007, urging operators to see if they are affected and to take timely action to avoid paying the daily charge.",
     "A multi-media campaign has been running in the national and London press, and posters at the roadside and at Eurotunnel, a radio campaign, and press adverts in a wide selection of specialist press have raised awareness of the zone.",
     "An extensive direct mail campaign has targeted companies with an operator licence and operators of non-compliant vehicles seen in the zone.",
