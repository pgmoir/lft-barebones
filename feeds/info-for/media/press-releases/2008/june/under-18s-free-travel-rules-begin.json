     "This measure will make enforcement of the free travel concession easier",
     "New rules on the use of free travel for young people on buses and trams came into force this weekend.",
     "From yesterday everyone aged 11 and over who qualifies for concessionary travel must touch in with a valid Oyster photocard when boarding a bus or at a tram stop in order to travel for free.",
     "The new measures mean that all young people aged 11 and over who want to benefit from free bus and tram travel must apply for an Oyster photocard.",
     "Application forms are available at Post Offices across the Capital.",
     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: 'Most young people behave themselves on the buses, but it is important that those who don't realise that free travel is a privelege that has been paid for and is not their automatic right regardless of their actions.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Restoring civility\"}",
     "'Making it compulsory for young people to carry a valid Oyster photocard and touch in for each journey, alongside our expansion of police numbers on the buses, is part of our effort to restore civility on our transport network, and halt the antisocial behaviour that can make travelling a misery for some passengers.",
     "'This measure will make enforcement of the free travel concession easier and prepares the way for Payback London, which will see those young people who have their Oyster photocards withdrawn for bad behaviour given the opportunity to earn them back by engaging in Community Service.'",
     "Steve Burton, Director of Community Safety, Policing and Enforcement at Transport for London, said: 'With these changes coming into effect, we hope that the thousands of young persons who enjoy free travel will continue to do so.",
     "'I encourage the young people who have yet to apply to do so today.",
     "'Application is easy and we will do our very best to process late applications as quickly as possible.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Apply now\"}",
     "Fourteen and 15 year-olds have been using Oyster photocards to qualify for free travel since the concession was first introduced in September 2005, and those who still hold valid photocard do not need to apply for a replacement.",
     "The 11-15 Oyster photocard has been available since January.",
     "Since then, posters about the Zip scheme have been displayed on the bus network and schools have been contacted to spread awareness of the changes to the free travel arrangements, which include mandatory validation of an Oyster photocard on every journey.",
     "Anyone without a valid Oyster photocard will have to pay the adult cash single fare for their journey.",
     "Anyone found travelling without a valid Oyster photocard which they have touched in or a ticket for their journey may be liable for a Â£20 penalty fare.",
