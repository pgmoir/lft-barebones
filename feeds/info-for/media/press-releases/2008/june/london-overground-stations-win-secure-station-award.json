     "Since then TfL has ensured that all stations are staffed while trains are running and has also launched a network-wide station upgrade programme.",
     "As a result a recent survey by British Transport Police (BTP) found that almost 82 per cent of the passengers now feel they are safer on the stations.",

     "Commenting, Mayor Boris Johnson, said: 'This is excellent news and evidence that by focusing on details, such as careful design and better management, we can make a real difference to levels of safety for commuters.",
     "'In my manifesto I made a specific commitment to using the principles of design to reduce crime and make stations safer, and I will be encouraging this kind of thinking across the whole of the Capital's transport system to ensure that everyone travelling in London feels safe and secure.'",

     "Managing Director of London Rail at TfL, Ian Brown, said: 'We're delighted about these first ten stations, but that is just the beginning.",
     "'We are determined that all our stations will be safe. So as work on all the stations which we took over last November continues we shall be submitting them too for Secure Station status.",
