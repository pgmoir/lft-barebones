     "The funding is to be provided jointly by Transport for London (TfL), through its Climate Change Fund, and Cenex, the UK's National Centre of Excellence for Low Carbon and Fuel Cell Technologies.",
     "As part of its carbon reduction strategy, TfL's Public Carriage Office (PCO) is keen to work with motor manufacturers to introduce taxis with lower fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.",
     "The funding will be used to introduce a low carbon taxi demonstration project in London and the PCO has issued a Contract Notice to the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) inviting motor manufacturers to register their interest in supplying low carbon taxis.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Fuel efficient\"}",
     "The project highlights TfL's commitment to reducing the impact of public transport on the environment by making London's taxis more fuel efficient, which will significantly reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and help tackle climate change.",
     "Suitable low carbon technologies might include stop-start or 'micro-hybrid' technology where the engine cuts out automatically when the vehicle stops, and starts up again when the accelerator is pressed.",
     "This technology is already being used by many of the major car manufacturers as a means of reducing carbon dioxide emissions.",
     "London's taxis spend about 40 per cent of their time waiting at taxi ranks, at traffic signals, or waiting to pick up or drop off passengers.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Less pollution\"}",
     "Under these conditions, a micro-hybrid taxi is expected to reduce fuel consumption and carbon dioxide and other emissions by 10 to 15 per cent, as well as producing less noise and fewer harmful air pollutants.",
     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'As well as significantly cutting carbon dioxide emissions, we're looking for taxis that are quieter and produce fewer air pollutants, which will be good news for anyone who spends time in London.",
     "'Taxi drivers should be particularly pleased - they're more exposed than most to traffic pollution, and they should also see the benefit of cheaper fuel costs as low carbon taxis would use less than a standard taxi.'",
     "David Brown, Managing Director of Surface Transport at TfL, said: 'We are committed to reducing the impact of public transport on the environment, and have already taken significant steps to clean up emissions of particulates and nitrogen oxides from the taxi fleet.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Savings\"}",
     "'Now it's time to tackle carbon dioxide emissions.",
     "'With over 21,000 taxis on London's roads, making our taxi fleet more fuel efficient will lead to substantial carbon dioxide savings and help tackle climate change.'",
     "Robert Evans, CEO of Cenex, said: 'Cenex is looking forward to working with TfL to procure and trial innovative low carbon vehicle technology in London taxis.",
     "'We believe this project will attract a great deal of interest from both consumers and the motor industry.'",
     "TfL's Climate Change Fund will also support the introduction of a fuel efficient driving campaign aimed at both taxi and private hire drivers.",
     "Small changes, such as keeping tyres at the correct pressure and not accelerating sharply, can make a big difference to fuel consumption and emissions from an individual vehicle.",
