     "It would operate between Central Middlesex Hospital (in Park Royal) and Elgin Avenue, via White City, Ladbroke Grove and Harrow Road.",
     "An associated change is proposed for the route 316 which currently operates between Cricklewood (Edgware Road) and St. Charles Hospital.",
     "There are plans to extend the route from St. Charles Hospital to White City along St. Mark's Road and St. Ann's Road.",
     "The extension will provide a high frequency link between North Kensington and the areas around Latimer Road, and White City, as well as providing links from Queen's Park, Kilburn High Road, Brondesbury and Cricklewood.",
     "Both routes will use single-deck buses and provide new bus links to White City and the new Westfield Development.",
