     "London Underground has also boosted the frequency of trains on the Bank branch to help with passenger demand through the City and improve performance across the rest of the line.",

     "Work has also begun to upgrade the line, which will be completed in 2012.",
     "The installation of modern signalling together with a new automatic train control system will further increase capacity and reliability.",
     "Once the renewal of the line is finished London Underground will be able to transport 20 per cent more passengers on parts of the line and journeys will be 18 per cent faster.",
