     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'Residents of this part of London have been living in limbo for years whilst the scheme has been pored over, so it really is good news that Transport for London and the Borough councils can now get on with the much-needed improvements that promise to have a positive impact for the whole community.'",

     "Subject to having all necessary statutory consents, work on the A406 Bounds Green scheme is scheduled to begin in 2009, with completion in 2011.",
