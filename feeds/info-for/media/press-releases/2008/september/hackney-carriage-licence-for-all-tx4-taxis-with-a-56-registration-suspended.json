     "The Public Carriage Office (PCO) is suspending the Hackney Carriage licence of all TX4 taxis with a 56 registration (reg.).",
     "Previously, only 56 reg. TX4s which had not been inspected by the manufacturer, London Taxis International (LTI), had their licence suspended.",
     "Following a week-long investigation during which around 200 56 reg. TX4 taxis were inspected, LTI has not yet been able to identify the fault causing some of these vehicles to catch fire.",
     "As a result, they cannot be certain that the safety checks carried out on a number of 56 reg. TX4s this week are addressing the problem.",
     "On that basis, the PCO has no choice but to suspend the licence of all 56 reg. TX4s until the manufacturer can confirm this model is safe.",
     "Ed Thompson, Director of Taxi \u0026 Private Hire at the PCO, said: 'On the basis of information received from LTI today, we simply have no choice but to suspend the licence of all TX4 taxis with a 56 registration until LTI can confirm this model is safe.",
     "'They are working to resolve this issue as soon as possible.",
     "'This isn't a step we have taken lightly and we know it will be a blow for taxi drivers.",
     "Although nobody has been hurt to date, we just can't take any chances with the lives of taxi drivers, passengers and other road users.'",
     "He added: 'I would like to reassure passengers that the vast majority of London's 21,000 taxis are not affected and are safe to use.'",
     "A PCO notice will be sent to the owners concerned.",
     "Owners and drivers can call an enquiry line (020 7126 1980) over the weekend from 10:00 - 16:00 and from 09:00 - 16:00 throughout the week.",
