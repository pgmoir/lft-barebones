     "The Mayor of London, Transport for London (TfL) and the Metropolitan Police Service today launched the latest phase of the Safer Travel at Night campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of using illegal cabs.",
     "The award-winning campaign has been very successful to date, with cab-related sexual offences down 44 per cent since 2002*.",
     "The proportion of women using illegal cabs to get home late at night has also fallen from 19 per cent in 2003 to three per cent in 2008**.",
     "However, 104 cab-related sexual attacks were committed in 2007* and recent research shows that around half (48 per cent) of late night travellers incorrectly believe that minicabs can pick up passengers that approach them in the street**.",

     "Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: 'If there's one message I want to get across, it's that women should never travel in an illegal cab - it is just not safe.",

     "'To get two numbers for local licensed minicab firms and a black cab company you just need to text HOME to 60835.",
     "'Simply, it is a number that all those going out in London should save on their mobiles.'",
     "Steve Burton, TfL's Director of Community, Safety and Policy (CSEP) said: 'While we're pleased to see a drop in the proportion of women using illegal cabs, there is still a lot of work to be done.",
     "'Only ever use a booked licensed minicab, and when you make your booking, be sure to give the operator your name and ask for details of the driver and car that will turn up.",
     "'When the car arrives, check that it is the right vehicle and ask the driver to confirm their name and your destination.'",
     "Chief Superintendent Joe Royle, of the Transport Operational Command Unit (TOCU) said: 'The dangers of taking an illegal minicab should never be underestimated.",

     "Mayor Boris Johnson has taken a tough line on touting, and any licensed driver convicted of touting will now lose their Public Carriage Office (PCO) driver's licence.",
     "He also announced earlier this year that the number of dedicated cab enforcement officers in the Capital would be doubled to 68.",
     "The Cab Enforcement Unit, which is part of the TfL-funded TOCU, has made over 4,000 arrests for touting and cab-related offences since 2003.",
     "Transport for London is continuing to work with boroughs to look at new locations in outer London for marshalled taxi or private hire ranks, at which people can pick up a licensed taxi or book a licensed minicab before waiting in a safe environment.",
     "Late night marshalled taxi or private hire ranks have been established in areas of London which are particularly busy late at night, including Bromley, Beckenham, Kingston and Romford in outer London, and Cranbourn Street (near Leicester Square) and Liverpool Street in central London.",

The award, which receives entries from a number of countries around the world, is given to a project that best reflects excellence in problem-orientated policing.  TfL's entry was based on the Safer Travel at Night project partnership. The project's successes include the 'Know what you're getting into' public awareness campaign, more night buses than ever before, the licensing of all minicabs vehicles and operators, making taxi touting a recordable offence, marshalled taxi ranks and, by the end of 2005, all buses in the capital were fitted with CCTV\"]}",
