     "The 17-year-old from Wandsworth managed to wow the panel of judges including top DJ Nihal, MOBO award winning artist Kano and Head of Art at M\u0026C Saatchi, Tiger Savage with his acoustic soul song 'One Question'.",

     "The competition offered young people the exciting opportunity to show case their talent by uploading their own creative material.",
     "Following in the footsteps of the six 'Debutantes' who were mentored through dream job challenges by the likes of music video producer Sarah Chatfield, fashion designer Oswald Boateng and photographer Rankin, Josh will be mentored by music producer and manager Steven Budd to gain some invaluable insight into the music industry in September.",
     "Josh Osho said: 'I really hope that I can mould some sort of career in the music business- I'd be content at just making a living out of it, just being able to do what I love as a hobby and as a living.",
     "'It's everyone's dream to become more than that and it would be an unimaginable bonus to have my music known worldwide and maybe even become a legend in my field.'",
