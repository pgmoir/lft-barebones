     "Hello London, the media partnership formed by Transport for London (TfL) and Exterion Media, has unveiled Cancer Research UK's innovative advertising campaign on the Tube network to raise awareness and support for this year's Race for Life events around the UK.",
     "Over the next two weeks, as part of Race for Life's 'This Is Beating Cancer' advertising campaign, inspirational moments from Race for Life participants gearing up for this year's events will be shared live on over 140 digital screens across 25 London Underground stations.",
     "Utilising display technology by TINT, images and messages from participants tagging #RaceforLife, #RaceLace, @crukraceforlife and @RaceForLife on social media channels will display on digital advertising screens at key Tube and DLR stations including Bank, Bond Street, Canary Wharf, Cutty Sark DLR, Oxford Circus, Paddington, and Waterloo.",
     "The images will include photos of people wearing one pink lace in their trainers. As part of the 'This Is Beating Cancer' campaign, Cancer Research UK is encouraging people to wear a singular pink lace and share a picture tagging #RaceLace. The lace is a badge of honour for each person, signifying that they are taking part in Race for Life and helping to beat cancer.",
     "The campaign was planned and booked by MediaCom and Kinetic.",
     "Emily Smith, Head of Events Marketing at Cancer Research UK, said:",

By showcasing the brilliant people who have already signed up to an event, we want to inspire others to get involved too. Taking part in Race for Life is a great opportunity to make an impact in beating cancer by helping to fund our life-saving research.'",
     "Chris Reader, Head of Commercial Media at Transport for London, said:",

     "Stuart Thompson, European Director at TINT, said:",
     "'It's been an honour to be involved in such a prestigious project, the level of engagement in Race for Life's social channels lends itself perfectly to Social-Out-Of-Home advertising.
