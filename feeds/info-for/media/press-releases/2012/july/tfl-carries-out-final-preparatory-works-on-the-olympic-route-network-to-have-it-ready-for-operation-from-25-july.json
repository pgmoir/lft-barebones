     "Motorists reminded Games lanes in London, with the exception of the M4, will not be in operation or enforced until 06:00 Wednesday 25 July. Motorists urged 'don't get caught out - avoiding driving in central London, and around the ORN and Games venues'. Plan ahead using transport for London's (TfL's) special ORN film at \u003ca href=\"http://www.GetAheadoftheGames.com\"\u003ewww.GetAheadoftheGames.com\u003c/a\u003e ",
     "Transport for London (TfL) will this weekend carry out the final stage of physical works necessary to ensure the ORN in London is ready to begin operation on Wednesday 25 July - just two days before the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games - to get all athletes, officials and the world's media to their events on time.",
     "As the Capital completes its transformation into a massive sporting and cultural venue, and with just one week to go until the London 2012 Games begin, the athletes, officials and world's media are arriving in London in increasing numbers and final preparations are under way.",
     "From 21:00 on Friday 20 July, the last of the preparatory works will take place on the road network, lasting five nights.",
     "To keep disruption to a minimum, the majority of work will take place overnight.",
     "The works will progressively change London's road network so that, by the morning of Monday 23 July, London's road network will look and feel different, but enforcement of the Games lanes and the official switch on of the ORN will not be until 06:00 on Wednesday 25 July.",
     "TfL is urging motorists to check out a special film, explaining how the ORN, including the Games lanes, works and will be enforced at \u003ca href=\"http://www.getaheadofthegames.com/things-you-should-know/olympic-route-network.html\"\u003ewww.GetAheadoftheGames.com/things-you-should-know/olympic-route-network.html\u003c/a\u003e ",
     "Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: 'The Olympic Route Network is a requirement of all host cities and is vital in ensuring athletes, officials and the world's media get to their events on time.",
     "'Its length was slashed by one third of what had been planned and we're working hard to introduce changes to the road network as late as possible, to minimise the impact on Londoners and businesses.",
     "'But with the Games just over a week away, we're into the home straight and are working flat out to ensure we are ready to welcome the world.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"London's transformation\"}",
     "Leon Daniels, TfL's Managing Director for Surface Transport, said: 'London's transformation into a massive sporting and cultural venue is almost complete.",
     "'From this weekend we'll be carrying out the final physical works to ensure the ORN, including the Games lanes, is ready to be in operation and enforced from Wednesday 25 July.",
     "'London's roads are now exceptionally busy and we are working hard to support a great Games and keep London moving.",
     "'From next week and during the Games, roads around the Olympic Route Network will operate differently.",
     "'Our advice to road users is clear - don't get caught out.",
     "'Avoid driving in central London, around the ORN and Games venues.",
     "'If a journey by road is absolutely essential, plan ahead at \u003ca href=\"http://www.GetAheadoftheGames.com\"\u003ewww.GetAheadoftheGames.com\u003c/a\u003e and allow extra time.'",
     "The final stage of works over the weekend, which will be carried out by up to 2,000 contractors, include installing barriers for the restricted turns and simplifying junctions.",
     "The physical changes to the road network along the ORN will keep traffic flowing along the route where, in additional to any non-Games traffic, there will be 1,300 vehicles an hour carrying the athletes, officials and world's media to their events on time.",
     "Work to install three temporary pedestrian footbridges at Hyde Park Corner will also take place from Friday.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Overnight works\"}",
     "Most work will be overnight and will include short closures of parts of Hyde Park Corner and interim diversions.",
     "The bridges will help crowds get to and from the numerous Olympic and cultural events in the area, including the Olympic venues in Hyde Park, The Mall and Horse Guards Parade and the BT London Live site in Hyde Park.",
     "They will be situated between Grosvenor Crescent and the Wellington Arch island and Green Park.",
     "Work to prepare the ORN in London began at the start of July with the painting of Games lanes road markings and adjustments to 1,300 sets of traffic signals.",
     "Overnight on Tuesday 24 July, designated pedestrian crossings will be suspended and parking and loading bays along the route will be removed.",
     "The ORN is a requirement of the Host City contract and is vital in ensuring all athletes, officials and the world's media get to their London 2012 Games events on time.",
     "The ORN covers 109 miles in total in London although Games lanes will only be used on 30 miles of the network.",
     "They will operate alongside lanes for general traffic and will be reserved for the use of the athletes, coaches, technical officials and the world's media.",
     "The Games lanes will generally operate between 06:00 and midnight.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Open for business\"}",
     "Around 150 Variable Message Signs (VMS) have been placed along the ORN and clearly state to drivers that they may continue to use the road network as normal and are not restricted from using the Games lanes, with the exception of the M4 Games lane, until operation of the ORN begins next week.",
     "Compliance on the ORN is key to ensuring that the Games run smoothly and London keeps moving.",
     "A penalty charge of £130 will be issued to owners of vehicles who break the regulations in London, including driving in Games lanes or stopping along the route and any illegally parked vehicle will be removed to a vehicle pound and may incur a release fee of £200.",
     "In order to ensure that the Capital remains open for business and we can keep London moving prior to and during the Games, TfL's advice to road users is clear:",
