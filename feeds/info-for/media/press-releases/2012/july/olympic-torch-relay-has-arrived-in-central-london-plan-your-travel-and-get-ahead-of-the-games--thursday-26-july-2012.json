     "The Olympic Torch Relay will spend its last day touring London's streets today, travelling through the heart of the capital including Camden, Islington, City of London, Southwark, Lambeth, Wandsworth, Kensington and Chelsea, Hammersmith and Fulham and Westminster before finishing the day at a music concert in Hyde Park.",
     "Tomorrow it will travel along the River Thames from Hampton Court to City Hall before reappearing at the Olympic Park. Londoners are turning out in very large and enthusiastic crowds to welcome the Torch and today will be an exceptionally busy day on the road network and stations along the Olympic Torch Relay route.",
     "Transport for London's (TfL) advice to those coming out to see the Olympic Torch today is to stay local if possible and find a point along the route that is close to home or work to view it as it passes.",
     "Spectators should take public transport, walk or cycle to view the Torch and avoid driving - roads in central London will be exceptionally busy and there will not be any parking along the route.",
     "With the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games now just a day away, London's transformation into a massive sporting and cultural venue is virtually complete and now is the time to put Games-time travel plans into action.",
     "The Olympic Route Network (ORN) began full operation yesterday (25 July) and is working well but as Games traffic on the capital's streets increases further, roads in central London and around venues and the ORN will remain exceptionally busy.",
     "Drivers should continue to avoid driving in these locations, plan ahead and allow extra time for their journeys.",
     "Traffic in central and inner London on Wednesday was down by around 13.5 per cent on levels usually seen at this time of year as many motorists heeded TfL's advice to avoid driving in central London, around the ORN and venues.",
     "Games lanes on the ORN are being operated flexibly and, if numbers of Games vehicles are low, they are being opened to all traffic.",
     "Yesterday, around a quarter of the 30 miles of  Games lanes on the ORN were in operation for the use of Games vehicles only.",
     "Variable Message Signs (VMS) are clearly advising motorists if the Games lanes are open to general traffic or not.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE, said: `Traffic levels yesterday were around 13.5 per cent lower than they would normally be at this time of year, due to motorists heeding our advice about avoiding driving in central London, near venues or on and around the ORN. Londoners have yet again proved how sensible they are, and I'd like to thank them for their help in reducing traffic in London - which is now truly an Olympic city.",
     "`As the Olympic Torch makes its way through central London today roads and stations along the route will be exceptionally busy and spectators should stay local and find a viewing point that is close to home or work. There is no point driving to see the Torch as there won't be any parking. Take public transport, walk or cycle instead.'",
