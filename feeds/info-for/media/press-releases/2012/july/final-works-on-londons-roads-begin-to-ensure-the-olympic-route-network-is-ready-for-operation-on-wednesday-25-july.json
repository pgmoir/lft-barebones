     "Transport for London (TfL) last night commenced the final stage of physical works that will ensure the Olympic Route Network (ORN) in London is ready to begin operation on Wednesday (25 July) - just two days before the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games - to get all athletes, officials and the world's media to their events on time.",
     "As London is transformed into a massive sporting and cultural venue and with just one week to go until the Games begin, final preparatory works to build the ORN successfully took place at Westminster Bridge last night. Over four nights, around 2,000 contractors will continue to install barriers and simplify over 120 junctions along the ORN across London.",
     "The works, taking place overnight to keep disruption to a minimum, will continue to progressively change London's road network and by Monday morning, London's roads will look and feel different and will be ready for the Games lanes to be enforced from 06:00 on Wednesday (25 July).",
     "Images of last night's build at Westminster are available to download free from the \u003ca title=\"TfL image gallery\"href=\"http://www.tflpressgallery.co.uk\"\u003eTfL Image gallery\u003c/a\u003e or as video footage from \u003ca title=\"Yousendit\"href=\"http://yousend.it/NDPMyU.\"\u003eYousendit\u003c/a\u003e ",

     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Transforming London's roads\"}",
     "TfL began transforming London's roads at the start of July, when painting of Games lanes road markings began, followed by adjustments to 1,300 sets of traffic signals.",
     "Work to install three temporary pedestrian footbridges at Hyde Park Corner also commenced last night and will include short closures of parts of Hyde Park Corner and interim diversions.",
     "The bridges will help crowds get to and from the numerous Olympic and cultural events in the area, including the Olympic venues in Hyde Park, The Mall and Horse Guards Parade and the BT London Live site in Hyde Park.",
     "The final stage of works will commence on Tuesday (24 July), the night before the ORN go-live, when designated pedestrian crossings will be suspended and certain parking and loading bays along the route are removed.",
     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: \"The Olympic Route Network is a requirement of all Host Cities and is vital in ensuring athletes, officials and the world's media get to their events on time.",
     "Its length was slashed by one third of what had been planned and we're working hard to introduce changes to the road network as late as possible, to minimise the impact on Londoners and businesses.",
     "\"With the Games less than a week away, the excitement is building and we're into the final stages of preparations to ensure we are ready to welcome the world.\"",
     "Leon Daniels, MD for Surface Transport said: \"There was a hive of activity in the area around the Westminster Bridge last night.  Over the weekend, up to 2,000 people will be working hard to transform London's roads so that the ORN is ready to carry around 1,300 vehicles an hour from Wednesday when enforcement begins.",

     "The ORN covers 109 miles in total in London although Games lanes will only be used on 30 miles of the network.",
     "They will operate alongside lanes for general traffic and will be reserved for the use of the athletes, coaches, technical officials and the world's media.",
     "The Games lanes will generally operate between 06:00 to midnight.",
     "Around 150 Variable Message Signs (VMS) have been placed along the ORN and clearly state to drivers that they may continue to use the road network as normal and are not restricted from using the Games lanes, with the exception of the M4 Games lane, until operation of the ORN begins on Wednesday (25 July).",
     "Compliance on the ORN is key to ensuring that the Games run smoothly and London keeps moving. A penalty charge of £130 will be issued to owners of vehicles who break the regulations in London, including driving in Games lanes or stopping along the route and any illegally parked vehicle will be removed to a vehicle pound and may incur a release fee of £200.",
