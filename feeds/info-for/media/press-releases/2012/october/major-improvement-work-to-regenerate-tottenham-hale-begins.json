     "Transport for London (TfL) has begun major work in Tottenham Hale to improve facilities for pedestrians and cyclists and return the gyratory to two-way traffic, as part of its ongoing work to improve the capital's streets.",
     "The scheme will take around two years to fully complete with the aim of improving access for residents and making the area more accessible for those walking or cycling.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Bigger, better bus station\"}",
     "The existing bus station by Tottenham Hale station will also be expanded to significantly improve interchange between bus and train services and a new public space with trees, benches and additional cycle parking for the local community created, providing a new area for local residents to relax, play and catch up.",
     "This work forms part of the Mayor of London Boris Johnson's Great Outdoors Programme, which aims to revitalise London's network of streets, paths, passages, broadways, squares and other public spaces to help breathe new life into the capital's urban environment and encourage people to walk and cycle.",
     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'I am determined to give local people a better deal on the roads; and this scheme is designed to make Tottenham Hale an easier, safer and more attractive proposition for every road user.",
     "'These works will support the wider regeneration of the area and help us provide a road network that is not just a relic of 1960s urban planning but one that is fit for the 21st century.'",
     "Restoring two-way traffic throughout the area will significantly improve the road network by providing more route options for travelling in both directions through the area, as well as easier access for local residents and businesses.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Work underway\"}",
     "Cllr Alan Strickland, Haringey Council's Cabinet Member for Economic Development and Social Inclusion, said: 'Kick-starting the gyratory works and road improvements around Tottenham Hale was one of Haringey Council's 12 in 2012 pledges to improve Tottenham for everyone who lives and works in the area. It's great news that this work is finally underway.'",
     "Garrett Emmerson, Chief Operating Officer for Surface Transport at TfL said: 'Tottenham Hale is an area currently undergoing huge levels of regeneration. These works to deliver improved facilities for pedestrians and cyclists, as well as smoother journeys throughout the area, will help support the changes and deliver safe, reliable and cared for streets throughout the area.'",
     "From autumn 2012, work will begin along the High Road between Seven Sisters Road and Monument Way to improve the footways and prepare the area for two-way traffic operation.",
     "Better facilities for pedestrians and cyclists will be installed throughout the area, as well as adding more than 70 mature trees and creating new shared spaces through the area to help further encourage cycling.",
     "Following this work, TfL will begin expanding the bus station by Tottenham Hale station and create a new public space for local residents, commuters and businesses. The scheme will also see the speed limit along Broad Lane reduced to 20 mph, helping to further improve pedestrian and cyclist safety for local residents, school pupils and students.",
     "In order to reduce the disruption that these works could cause to businesses in the local area, TfL has been working closely with its contractor to minimise the construction impact of the project.",
     "Roadworks will be carried out to avoid peak traffic hours and be undertaken at times when traffic is lighter, including during evenings, nights and weekends. TfL will also be working closely with Haringey Council's environmental team to keep noise within agreed limits.",
     "Innovative working methods such as noise-dampening barriers will be used to ensure that local residents are not affected by these overnight works.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe improvements to local roads are in addition to £41m of regeneration investment planned for the area by the Mayor of London and Haringey Council. Investment through the fund will work in Tottenham across the following areas:",
