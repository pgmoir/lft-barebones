Many of these are in highly skilled roles and TfL has a vital role to play in ensuring these skills are maintained and passed on to the future.

Since finding the highways technician apprenticeship I haven't looked back.",
     "'I am thoroughly enjoying my job, while at the same time studying for management and civil engineering qualifications. It has been a steep learning curve but I have learnt a lot, gained invaluable experience, discovered new areas of interest, and I am very much looking forward to the future.'",
