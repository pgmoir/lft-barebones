     "Mike Brown, Managing Director of London Underground, said: 'London Underground has always played a hugely important role in the success of our city - from the growth of the early network which led to the expansion of the suburbs in the last century, to the development of Canary Wharf's financial powerhouse in the 80s, and on to today's system which successfully moved record numbers of people during the Queen's Jubilee and London 2012 Games.",
     "'As we mark the 150th anniversary of the world's first underground railway with a range of wonderful events, we are also building for the future - transforming stations and replacing trains, signals and track to create a truly 21st century network able to maintain London's vital role in the UK economy.'",
