     "Free travel on Transport for London (TfL) services for all Londoners when they reach 60 years old will be restored from 1 November when the 60+ London Oyster photocard scheme goes live.",
     "The new scheme fulfils the Mayor Boris Johnson's pledge to bridge the gap for older Londoners since the age of eligibility for the London Council's Freedom Pass was raised by the Government.",
     "More than 100,000 applications are expected before the new 60+ London Oyster photocard goes live, and a further 10,000 Londoners are expected to become eligible for the scheme each month.",
     "Eligibility for the Freedom Pass, for both men and women, was raised by the Government in line with the state retirement age for women since April 2010 and means Londoners currently have to be at least 61 years old to qualify.",
     "The 60+ London Oyster photocard scheme will mean Londoners once again become eligible for free travel on all TfL services and some national rail services 24 hours a day, seven days a week, from their sixtieth birthday. Just like the Freedom Pass, it will also allow them free travel outside of morning peak hours on other national rail services in the capital.",
     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'Londoners who have grafted all their lives and expected to receive free travel on retirement just as those before them quite rightly felt cheated when the age escalator removed the Freedom Pass from their grasp. I promised to restore this right to travel for free on the capital's transport network for every Londoner from their 60th birthday.",
     "'From November, this will be the case when hundreds of thousands of people will be armed with their 60+ London Oyster card, enjoying all our great city can offer.'",
     "Shashi Verma, TfL's Director of Customer Experience, said: 'From 1 November, Londoners who are 60 years or over and are not eligible to receive a Freedom Pass will be able to travel for free on all TfL services, at any time of the day.",
