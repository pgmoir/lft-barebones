     "London's over-60s are now able to travel for free on all Transport for London (TfL) and some National Rail services with their new 60+ London Oyster photocard.",
     "Launching this week, the \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/60pluslondon\"\u003e60+ London Oyster photocard \u003c/a\u003e bridges the gap for older Londoners until they reach the age of eligibility for the London Council's Freedom Pass.",
     "More than 15,000 applications have been received for the new concession, and around 12,000 cards have already been issued.",
     "The 60+ London Oyster photocard means Londoners once again become eligible for free travel on London Underground, London Overground, buses Docklands Light Railway (DLR), trams and some National Rail services 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week, from their 60th birthday.",
     "Just like the Freedom Pass, it will also allow them free travel outside of morning peak hours on other National Rail services in the Capital.",
     "In April 2010, eligibility for the London Council's Freedom Pass for both men and women was raised to be in line with the state retirement age for women, which is going up in increments of one month every two months, and means Londoners currently have to be at least 61 years old to qualify.",
     "Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: 'I'm delighted to be able to give back free travel to those hard working Londoners who expected to receive it when they reached 60, only to have the goal posts moved and it snatched from their grasp.",
     "'As a key manifesto commitment, I promised not only to protect the Freedom Pass but to restore this right for free travel to every Londoner from their 60th birthday.",
     "'Londoners have now been taken off the age escalator and it's great to hear so many are already benefitting having signed up for their 60+ London Oyster photocard.'",
     "Samantha Mauger, Chief Executive of Age UK London, said: 'We welcome the restoration of free travel in London to 60 year olds.",
     "'For many people, getting a Freedom Pass is one of the best things about getting older.",
     "'Access to public transport is a lifeline for older people and without the Freedom Pass many are at greater risk of social isolation.",
     "'We are very pleased that Mayor Boris Johnson has delivered on his pledge to bridge the gap for older Londoners.'",
     "Applications for the \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/60pluslondon\"\u003e60+ London Oyster photocard\u003c/a\u003e are now open.",
     "A 60+ web account will be set up for online applicants to get updates on their application or to report lost, stolen or damaged photocards.",
