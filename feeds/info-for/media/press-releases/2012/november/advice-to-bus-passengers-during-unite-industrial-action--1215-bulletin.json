     "TfL has this afternoon issued travel advice to bus passengers affected by strike action by members of the Unite union who work for Arriva London North.",
     "The strike action, which began at 03:00 this morning, has severely affected bus services in north London.",
     "The strike action will continue until 02:59 tomorrow (Friday 30 November) affecting bus services throughout today and night bus services operating overnight (Thursday night into Friday morning).",
     "Day bus services on Friday will operate as normal.",
     "There are services running on 24 of the 46 affected bus routes (4 additional affected routes are school services that operate morning and evening only).",
     "There is a full service on the route 325 and an almost full service on routes 135, 150 and 173.",
     "Bus services operated by other companies across the Capital are unaffected and will operate a normal service.",
     "The strike action is due to a pay dispute between members of the Unite union who work at several north London bus garages and their employers, Arriva London North, who operate around 10 per cent of bus services in London.",
     "The strike has disrupted 50 bus routes in north London including some routes into central London such as the 29, 38, 73, 149 and 243.",
     "We anticipate that some Tube stations in north and central London, including Victoria, Seven Sisters, Tottenham Hale, Wood Green and Turnpike Lane are going to be busier than normal - so passengers are being urged to allow a little more time to complete their journeys today.",
     "TfL is calling for Unite and Arriva London North to expedite negotiations and resolve the dispute so that disruption to passengers can be kept to a minimum.",
     "TfL has deployed extra staff to assist passengers at various locations, including bus stops and bus stations, and to hand out walking maps.",
     "TfL is keeping passengers informed of the status of their services in a range of ways.",
     "These include:",
