Advanced signal monitoring technology helps indicate potential failure and Automated Track Monitoring Systems (ATMS) will automatically identify any track related defects so that corrective maintenance activities can be planned to minimise disruption to passengers.  A prototype ATMS system is now in operation and 12 trains will be fitted with the system, providing up to two service trains on the Bakerloo, Central, Victoria and Sub surface lines by late 2012.\",\"An initiative launched with the British Transport Police (BTP) has seen some of the Tube's Emergency Response Unit (ERU) vehicles designated as police vehicles and driven by trained BTP officers for speedier response to serious incidents. Since the trial began in February the ERU response time to incidents in central London has been almost halved. From 1 July LU will be increasing staffing of ERU depots from 101 to more than 130.\",\"London Underground is increasing its incident response capabilities, and developing plans to co-locate engineering and operations staff in one command and control centre so it can speed up the time it takes to recover from incidents.\",\"The installation of covers on the emergency call units on Victoria line trains has significantly reduced the number of accidental activations by passengers. Similar covers are being designed and fitted to the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly fleets prior to the 2012 Games before further roll-out to the Bakerloo, Central and District lines.\",\"A huge range of other programmes are being taken forward in order to reduce delays, including the upgrades of Tube signalling and fleets, new technology and resources to combat cable theft, work to learn from other metros and leading companies and communications campaigns aimed at staff, contractors and passengers to explain how to help keep Tube services running smoothly.\"]}",
