     "Today Transport for London (TfL) issued a reminder about travel advice to enable Londoners and visitors to enjoy the events and to get around the city.",
     "Central London will be very busy throughout the entire weekend, and TfL is advising everyone intending to be in central London to use public transport, plan their journeys ahead and to check before they travel by visiting: \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/diamondjubilee\"\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk/diamondjubilee\u003c/a\u003e .",
     "Drivers are advised to avoid central London between 3 and 5 June.  On Sunday 3 June all central London bridges will be closed for all or part of the day, so it is particularly important to avoid central London.",
     "On Monday evening, those attending the Diamond Jubilee concert are advised to plan their home journey in advance and to leave plenty of time to leave the venue and to travel to a London Underground station and to make their connections.  There are likely to be queues at London Underground stations near to the venue.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLive travel updates will be provided on the TfL website and via TfL's Twitter feeds visit tfl.gov.uk/socialmedia for more information.",
     "Peter Hendy CBE, London's Transport Commissioner, said:  \"The events planned to mark The Queen's Diamond Jubilee are set to be both a fantastic and fitting spectacle, and our staff and those of our contractors will be working hard to ensure that Londoners and visitors can get around the city.",
     "\"Central London will be very busy throughout the weekend and everyone intending to be in central London should use public transport, plan their journeys ahead and check before they travel.",
     "\"Road closures and bus diversions will mean that some people have to travel in different ways - particularly on the Sunday. Due to a number of road and bridge closures, motorists are advised particularly to avoid central London for all but essential journeys on that day.  Central London will also be very busy during Monday evening and those attending late evening events should allow additional time for their journey home.",
     "\"By planning ahead and checking before travelling everyone will be able to get where they need to be, and have a great time celebrating the Diamond Jubilee.\"",
