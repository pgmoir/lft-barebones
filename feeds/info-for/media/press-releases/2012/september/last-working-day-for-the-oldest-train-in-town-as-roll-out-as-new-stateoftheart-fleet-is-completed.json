     "Now, after 50 years of service, the next generation of trains has taken over with the line being completely served by new walk-through, air-conditioned trains.",
     "A huge amount of work has been carried out to ensure that the signals, track and platforms, some of which date back over 100 years, were ready in time to accommodate the new trains which are longer and more powerful.",
     "In total, 191 new trains are being introduced across the Circle, District, Hammersmith \u0026 City and Metropolitan lines, together representing some 40 per cent of the Tube network.",
     "These improvements for passengers are part of London Underground's vital programme to replace old track, signals and trains.",
     "It will further improve performance and deliver more reliable services for Londoners, with faster and more frequent journeys, fewer delays and, ultimately, provide 30 per cent more capacity across the network.",
     "The programme has delivered major improvements for Tube passengers over the last few years, including:",

The line is now twice as reliable as it was in 2007/08 and there are an extra two trains each hour in the peak, meaning a train every two minutes. From early 2013 there'll be even more trains - up to 33 every hour\"]}",
     "Mike Brown, Managing Director, London Rail and Underground, said: 'The old Metropolitan line trains have been great servants to the millions of people that have used the line over the years.",
     "'However at over 50 years old, it is now time to bring in the new generation of trains that are walk-through, air conditioned and more accessible.",
     "'Carrying more passengers today than ever before we need to continue to meet the growing demand of an increasing population.",
     "'Passenger service has already been improved through the upgrade of the Jubilee and Victoria lines with increased reliability and capacity and the Northern, Circle, District, Hammersmith \u0026 City and Metropolitan upgrade works are well under way.",
     "'We know there is still much to do to move forward and build for the future.'",
     "The first of the new trains are now arriving on the Hammersmith \u0026 City line.",
