     "This work will further improve performance and deliver reliable Tube services for Londoners - with faster and more frequent journeys, fewer delays and, ultimately, 30 per cent more service across the network.",
     "This is vital to cope with the city's growing population and to support the growth of the London - and UK - economy.",
     "The programme will include maintenance work on key lines to ensure track, points and tunnel structures remain in the best possible repair, while also putting in brand new signalling to replace the very old systems on the Northern, Metropolitan, District and Circle lines.",
     "Every effort is being made to keep disruption to an absolute minimum and, through detailed planning, the effect of the works has been reduced by 10 per cent compared to last year and by 25 per cent compared to two years ago.",
     "As much work as possible is done in the few hours each night when the Tube does not operate, but sometimes - for example with heavy work such as track replacement - there is no option but to close sections of line while we dig out and replace whole sections of the railway tracks.",

Such a closure will be used on the Hainault branch of the Central line in the last week of October and the first few days of November\"]}",

     "'During the London 2012 Games the network successfully kept London moving and carried more people than at any other time in its 149 year history.",
     "'But to continue to deliver for London, we need to keep going with the programme of improvements that will provide the extra capacity to support the city's growing population and ensure that equipment is maintained and replaced before it wears out and causes failures and disruption.",
     "'I know that all closures are frustrating, and we are making every effort to keep disruption to a minimum and to provide information and alternative travel options.",
     "'We have reduced the effect of the closures by 10 per cent compared with last year and at least 80 per cent of stations remain served at weekends, and key periods, including the run-up to Christmas, will see no line closures at all.",
     "'We will also be using every possible way of communicating with our customers to keep them fully informed of the best way to get around.'",

     "These improvements, together with an enhanced programme of maintenance carried out ahead of the Games, helped London Underground during London 2012 to continue the trend of improved performance while carrying a record number of passengers.",
     "The Tube carried over 60 million passenger journeys - the most in its 149-year history and up by around 30 per cent on normal levels.",
