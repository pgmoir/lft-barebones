     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson has today announced £4.9m for Barnet to invest in transport projects that will benefit the local community.",
     "TfL has allocated the money through Local Implementation Plan (LIP) funding for the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy.",
     "The funding is awarded to support projects in the London boroughs that will make cycling safer and easier, improve walking facilities, make roads safer, smooth traffic flow and breathe new life into town centres, public squares and local shopping areas to boost the local economy.",
     "The £4.9m funding package in 2013/14 will finance a range of transport projects in Barnet, including:",

     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: 'This funding will benefit all of London and everyone living in, working in or visiting Barnet.",
     "'A world-class city deserves a world-class transport system and the borough will use this money to make significant improvements for local people.'",
     "This year, two new measures have been introduced which will help the boroughs to drive down their costs, deliver value for money and minimise the disruption caused by construction works and road maintenance.",
     "Boroughs can use the new London Highways Alliance Contracts (LoHAC) to avoid the need for each authority to separately appoint contractors to undertake works.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Local investment\"}",
     "These are four area-based joint highway contracts awarded in November by TfL and the boroughs to reduce costs, provide consistency in the quality of works and materials and to minimise disruption.",
     "In addition, projects undertaken on main roads in the boroughs will be co-ordinated by TfL so that the method and timing of roadworks is managed to reduce their impact in the Capital and associated inconvenience and disruption to residents and road users.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE said: 'We are working in partnership with Barnet and with all the London boroughs to bring real improvements to communities across the city.",
     "'The borough will be using this investment to fund hundreds of projects that will benefit all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians.",
     "'Public squares and local shopping areas will be rejuvenated, attracting more people to the area to boost the local economy.'",
     "Last year in Barnet, it funded 122 new on and off-street cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 580 children and the removal of 348 metres of guardrail.",
     "Notable larger projects undertaken this year in Barnet include two major redevelopment schemes at Cricklewood and North Finchley that received £130,000 of LIP funding.",
     "This will complement funding from the Outer London Fund to achieve a significant improvement to the urban realm and to support growth and regeneration of the area.",
