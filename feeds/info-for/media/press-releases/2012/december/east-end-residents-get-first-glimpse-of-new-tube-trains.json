     "Trains on the Hammersmith \u0026 City and Circle lines are currently comprised of six carriages.",
     "The new trains will be longer, providing 17 per cent extra capacity and relieving pressure on busy parts of the network.",
     "Nigel Holness, Director of Operational Change and Upgrades, London Underground, said: 'This is great news for our customers in the east end of London. The trains are longer, walk-through and in the summer customers will be able to benefit from the air conditioning too.",
     "'It is the first of 53 new trains that will operate on the Hammersmith \u0026 City and Circle lines and will start rolling out in earnest from Spring next year.'",
     "In addition the trains will have automated visual displays and station announcements, plus CCTV, as well as dedicated wheelchair areas, wider doors and walkways, lower passenger alarms and a smaller gap between the train and platform.",
     "The roll out of the first train along the complete route of the Hammersmith \u0026 City line also marks the completion of works at Hammersmith station and depot to accommodate the new longer trains.",
     "This included extending the platforms and tracks and building a new ticket office and train crew depot.\u003cbr /\u003e",
