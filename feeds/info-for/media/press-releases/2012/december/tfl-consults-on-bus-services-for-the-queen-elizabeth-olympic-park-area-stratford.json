     "There will be new neighbourhoods including the former Athletes Village, now renamed East Village, providing thousands of new homes, together with schools, nurseries, a library, health centres and other community facilities.",
     "The Park will help generate thousands of new jobs and sporting venues from the Games - such as the Olympic Stadium and Aquatics Centre - will provide leisure facilities for the whole community.",
     "In preparation for the transformation, TfL has developed proposals for a number of bus routes to connect the Park and Stratford City with surrounding areas.",
     "The consultation period is open until 22 February 2013.",
     "Peter Bradley, Head of Consultation Delivery, said: 'The services we provide in and around the Park will be used by many thousands of people for years to come so we want as many people as possible responding to this consultation.",
     "'It's an exciting opportunity to be involved in the development of such an historic area that holds some very special memories.'",
     "Subject to the outcome of the consultation, the changes will start being made during 2013 when the new roads become available and tenants start moving in.",
