     "The Woolwich Ferry is a free service which carries more than 50,000 passengers and 20,000 vehicles per week. The service links Woolwich with North Woolwich, linking two ends of the Inner London orbital roads, the north and south circular. A ferry has operated at Woolwich since the 14th century. It has been operated from its current position since 1889 when the first free ferry service began with the current ferry terminals being introduced in 1965.",

     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"On weekdays, the Woolwich Ferry operates 06:10 until 20:00 with a two boat service (10 minutes between sailings), on Saturdays from 06:10 until 20:00 with a one boat service (15 minutes between sailings), and Sundays 11:30 until 19:30 with a one boat service (15 minutes between sailings).  The last south to north sailings are 15 minutes before service ends\",\"TfL is currently in the second phase of a public consultation on new river crossings in south and south east London. One proposal is a new vehicle ferry which would provide a river crossing linking Beckton directly with Thamesmead at Gallions Reach. If this proposal is taken forward and subject to planning permission, funding and other consents being granted, the earliest opening date for the Gallions Reach Ferry is 2017.
