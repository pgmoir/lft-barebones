     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson has today announced £4.2m for Hillingdon to invest in transport projects that will benefit the local community.",
     "TfL has allocated the money through Local Implementation Plan (LIP) funding for the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy.",
     "The funding is awarded to support projects in the London boroughs that will make cycling safer and easier, improve walking facilities, make roads safer, smooth traffic flow and breathe new life into town centres, public squares and local shopping areas to boost the local economy.",
     "The £4.2m funding package in 2013/14 will finance a range of transport projects in Hillingdon, including:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"£120,000 for bus stop accessibility improvements, such as raising kerb height, relocating the bus flag and bus shelter and footway and carriageway resurfacing to ensure bus stops are easy to use and accessible to all\",\"£320,000 to implement school safety measures such as the introduction of 20mph speed limits, enhancing existing traffic calming and school crossing patrols\",\"£60,000 for pedestrian wayfinding signs in Ruislip Manor and Northwood Hills\",\"£134,000 for Grand Union Canal.  To complete works to the towpath over the whole length including Paddington Arm, to encourage more cycling and walking\"]}",
     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: 'This funding will benefit all of London and everyone living in, working in or visiting Hillingdon.",
     "'A world class city deserves a world class transport system and the borough will use this money to make significant improvements for local people.'",
     "This year, two new measures have been introduced which will help the boroughs to drive down their costs, deliver value for money and minimise the disruption caused by construction works and road maintenance.",
     "Boroughs can use the new London Highways Alliance Contracts (LoHAC) to avoid the need for each authority to separately appoint contractors to undertake works.",
     "These are four area-based joint highway contracts awarded in November by TfL and the boroughs to reduce costs, provide consistency in the quality of works and materials and to minimise disruption.",
     "In addition, projects undertaken on main roads in the boroughs will be co-ordinated by TfL so that the method and timing of roadworks is managed to reduce their impact in the Capital and associated inconvenience and disruption to residents and road users.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE said: 'We are working in partnership with Hillingdon and with all the London boroughs to bring real improvements to communities across the city.",
     "'The borough will be using this investment to fund hundreds of projects that will benefit all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians.",
     "'Public squares and local shopping areas will be rejuvenated, attracting more people to the area to boost the local economy.'",
     "Last year in Hillingdon, it financed cycle training for 1700 children and 200 adults, 219 new street trees, 417 cycle parking spaces, road safety education to 3,810 pupils in 30 schools and walking promotions at  55 schools through Hillingdon's Smarter Travel programme.",
