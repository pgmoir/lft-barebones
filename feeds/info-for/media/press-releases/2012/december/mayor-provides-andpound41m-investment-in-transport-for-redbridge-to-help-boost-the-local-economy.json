     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson has today announced £4.1m for Redbridge to invest in transport projects that will benefit the local community.",
     "TfL has allocated the money through Local Implementation Plan (LIP) funding for the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy.",
     "The funding is awarded to support projects in the London boroughs that will make cycling safer and easier, improve walking facilities, make roads safer, smooth traffic flow and breathe new life into town centres, public squares and local shopping areas to boost the local economy.",
     "The £4.1m funding package in 2013/14 will finance a range of transport projects in Redbridge, including:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"£349,000 to carry out design studies for new pedestrian facilities and improvement works at a number of sites along the A104 and other nearby roads, including a new, safe footpath for school children to Wells Primary School from Woodford High Road\",\"£185,000 for School Travel Plans to build on the positive progress already achieved in the borough\",\"£5,000 to update the borough's air quality map which will help determine the appropriate measures to be implemented in order to help reduce pollution\"]}",
     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: 'This funding will benefit all of London and everyone living in, working in or visiting Redbridge.",
     "'A world class city deserves a world class transport system and the borough will use this money to make significant improvements for local people.'",
     "This year, two new measures have been introduced which will help the boroughs to drive down their costs, deliver value for money and minimise the disruption caused by construction works and road maintenance.",
     "Boroughs can use the new London Highways Alliance Contracts (LoHAC) to avoid the need for each authority to separately appoint contractors to undertake works.",
     "These are four area-based joint highway contracts awarded in November by TfL and the boroughs to reduce costs, provide consistency in the quality of works and materials and to minimise disruption.",
     "In addition, projects undertaken on main roads in the boroughs will be coordinated by TfL so that the method and timing of roadworks is managed to reduce their impact in the Capital and associated inconvenience and disruption to residents and road users.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE said: 'We are working in partnership with Redbridge and with all the London boroughs to bring real improvements to communities across the city.",
     "'The borough will be using this investment to fund hundreds of projects that will benefit all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians.",
     "'Public squares and local shopping areas will be rejuvenated, attracting more people to the area to boost the local economy.'",
     "Last year in Redbridge it funded 213 cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 562 children and 67 adults, 6 improved pedestrian crossings, 31 accessible bus stops, 40 schools to participate in walking events and 192 new street trees.",
     "Notable larger projects undertaken in Redbridge this year include further improvements to Wanstead High Street, which received £300,000 to improve the footways making it safer and easier for pedestrians to reach local shops and services.",

     "Each borough produces a Local Implementation Plan (LIP) to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.  While individual projects are the responsibility of each borough."
