     "Transport for London (TfL) has teamed up with the London Borough of Newham to engage residents and other road users to seek their views and opinions on the extension to Barclays Cycle Superhighway route 2, which currently runs from Bow to Aldgate.",
     "The extended route has been designed to increase cyclist safety as well as help minimise the impact on traffic levels.",
     "It would take cyclists from Bow through to Stratford - a major development area - and is subject to a public consultation which is to begin on 7 January 2013, with works due to start in late spring 2013.",
     "Current improvement plans for the extension include:",

     "TfL figures show cycle journeys on the existing section of the Barclays Cycle Superhighway route 2 have increased by 28 per cent from September 2010 to June 2012.",
     "This figure includes a 55 per cent increase in cycle numbers on Bow Road alone.",
     "As part of TfL's Better Junctions programme, which aims to improve facilities at junctions for cyclists, TfL have begun engaging with residents and businesses about proposed changes to the southeastern junction of Bow roundabout.",
     "This proposed scheme would look to install an early-start system similar to that installed on the northwestern arm earlier this year, as well as create a cycle bypass at the bus stop on Stratford High Street.",
     "Subject to the outcome of the public engagement work, TfL will begin to deliver improvements such as creating new cycle lanes and widening traffic islands, early next year.",
     "Barclays Cycle Superhighway designs build on lessons learned from the Cycle Safety Junction Review.",
     "Ben Plowden, Director of Planning, TfL Surface Transport said: 'This new extension will offer a more robust and intelligent design, adding huge improvements to the existing route.",
     "'We have had a lot of success with route 2, with an increase of 28 per cent in cycle journeys on the route compared to 16 per cent made off the route.",
     "'This extension to Stratford will offer cyclists more accessible, safe routes through London.",
     "'We want Newham residents to help us make cycling more convenient and safer by giving us their opinion at the forthcoming consultation meetings.'",
     "Sir Robin Wales, Mayor of Newham, said: 'We're pleased that TfL is consulting on plans to extend the Barclays Cycle Superhighway along both sides of the High Street between Bow and Stratford.",
     "'It's important that residents take part in the consultation so they can make sure the route incorporates all the design and safety aspects they want to see, resulting in high quality cycling infrastructure which will improve safety for cyclists, road users and pedestrians.'",
