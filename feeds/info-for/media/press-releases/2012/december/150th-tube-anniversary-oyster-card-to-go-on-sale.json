     "Oyster has revolutionised the way passengers pay for their travel, not only on the Tube, but also on trams, buses, the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), London Overground and National Rail services in London.",
     "Transport for London (TfL) is at the forefront of ticketing technology for a decade and is renowned for the success of Oyster with more than 80 per cent of all journeys on London's public transport made using an Oyster card and over 55 million cards issued since its introduction in 2003.",
     "TfL continues to seek ways to better passengers' experience of using Oyster with a range of improvements.",
     "These include enhanced Oyster online accounts providing detailed journey and fares history which are already in place and more interactive facilities in the future for completing journeys and applying for refunds.",
     "London Underground is organising a wide range of events and activities to mark this historic anniversary.",
     "These will look at the Tube's rich heritage and history and also at the vital role the London Underground has played, and will continue to play, in the economic success of the Capital.",
     "Passengers can use this souvenir Oyster card across the TfL network in the same way that they usually do, either as pay as you go or by adding their Travelcard to it.",
     "These cards are a limited edition and will be available at LU stations and TfL Travel Information Centres.",
     "TfL encourages all Oyster users to register their card and set up an online account to ensure any balance is protected if the card is lost or stolen.",
     "Online accounts also enable passengers to top up their credit online and view their journey history.",
     "Mike Brown, Managing Director for London Underground and London Rail, said: 'The growth of the world's first underground railway has always been very closely linked to the success of the London and the UK economy.",
     "'We continue to modernise the Tube system, with new signalling and trains being introduced to improve our customers' journeys.",
     "'Oyster ticketing has transformed the way Londoners and visitors pay for travelling around the Capital.",
     "'This wonderful souvenir Oyster card, just like the regular Oyster card, is the easiest, cheapest and best way to help our passengers move around the City.'",
