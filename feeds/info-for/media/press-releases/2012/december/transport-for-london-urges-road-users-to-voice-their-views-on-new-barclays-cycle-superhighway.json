As design progressed, it became increasingly apparent that in order to fulfil the Mayor's commitment to ensure the Cycle Superhighway is of sufficient high quality, physical constraints along this stretch would limit our ability to complete the route to these top standards. We are still very much committed to delivering significant cycling improvements on this part of the A20. Although they will not be formally branded as part of the superhighway, the route will still benefit from better cycling facilities, with 0.7km of new mandatory cycle lanes and substantial resurfacing of the roads\"]}"
