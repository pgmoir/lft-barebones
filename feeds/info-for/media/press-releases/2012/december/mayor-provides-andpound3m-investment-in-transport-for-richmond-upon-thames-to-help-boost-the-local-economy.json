     "The funding is awarded to support projects in the London boroughs that will make cycling safer and easier, improve walking facilities, make roads safer, smooth traffic flow and breathe new life into town centres, public squares and local shopping areas to boost the local economy.",
     "The £3m funding package in 2013/14 in Richmond will finance a range of transport projects including:",

     "'The borough will be using this investment to fund hundreds of projects that will benefit all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians.  Public squares and local shopping areas will be rejuvenated, attracting more people to the area to boost the local economy.'",
