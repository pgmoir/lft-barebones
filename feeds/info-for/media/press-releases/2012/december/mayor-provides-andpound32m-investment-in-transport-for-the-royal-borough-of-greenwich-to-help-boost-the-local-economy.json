     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson has today announced £3.2m for the Royal Borough of Greenwich to invest in transport projects that will benefit the local community.",
     "TfL has allocated the money through Local Implementation Plan (LIP) funding for the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy.",
     "\u003cbr /\u003eThe funding is awarded to support projects in the London boroughs that will make cycling safer and easier, improve walking facilities, make roads safer, smooth traffic flow and breathe new life into town centres, public squares and local shopping areas to boost the local economy.",
     "The £3.2m funding package in 2013/14 will finance a range of transport projects in Greenwich, including:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"£405,000 for the roll-out of 20mph zones and speed limits across residential streets in the borough\",\"£571,000 to make cycling safer and easier and progress the Cycling Action Plan.  This includes improved Greenways (off road traffic free paths and spaces for pedestrians and cyclists), cycle parking and infrastructure, free cycle training for adults and children and an innovative new cycle loan scheme in partnership with the Primary Care Trust\"]}",
     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: 'This funding will benefit all of London and everyone living in, working in or visiting Greenwich.",
     "'A world class city deserves a world class transport system and the borough will use this money to make significant improvements for local people.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Local investment\"}",
     "This year, two new measures have been introduced which will help the boroughs to drive down their costs, deliver value for money and minimise the disruption caused by construction works and road maintenance.",
     "Boroughs can use the new London Highways Alliance Contracts (LoHAC) to avoid the need for each authority to separately appoint contractors to undertake works.",
     "These are four area-based joint highway contracts awarded in November by TfL and the boroughs to reduce costs, provide consistency in the quality of works and materials and to minimise disruption.",
     "In addition, projects undertaken on main roads in the boroughs will be co-ordinated by TfL so that the method and timing of roadworks is managed to reduce their impact in the Capital and associated inconvenience and disruption to residents and road users.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE said: 'We are working in partnership with Greenwich and with all the London boroughs to bring real improvements to communities across the city.",
     "'The borough will be using this investment to fund hundreds of projects that will benefit all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians.",
     "'Public squares and local shopping areas will be rejuvenated, attracting more people to the area to boost the local economy.'",
     "Last year in Royal Greenwich, it funded 45 cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 1,020 children and 210 adults, 61 new accessible bus stops, for 30 schools to participate in walking events and 17 in cycling events and 103 new street trees.",
     "Notable larger projects undertaken this year include the continued roll-out of the local safety scheme programme that received £447,000.",
     "So far, this has included improvements at a number of locations across the borough, such as Woolwich Road to Woolwich Church Street, where £100,000 has been spent on the Bugsby's Way/Commercial Way junction and the Woolwich Road/Trafalgar Rd/Charlton Rd scheme which will be completed in the spring.",

     "Each borough produces a LIP to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.",
     "While individual tramsport projects are the responsibility of each borough."
