     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson has today announced £2.1m for Barking and Dagenham to invest in transport projects that will benefit the local community.",
     "TfL has allocated the money through Local Implementation Plan (LIP) funding for the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy.",
     "The funding is awarded to support projects in the London boroughs that will make cycling safer and easier, improve walking facilities, make roads safer, smooth traffic flow and breathe new life into town centres, public squares and local shopping areas to boost the local economy.",
     "The £2.1m funding package in 2013/14 will finance a range of transport projects in Barking \u0026 Dagenham, including:",

     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Local invesment\"}",
     "This year, two new measures have been introduced which will help the boroughs to drive down their costs, deliver value for money and minimise the disruption caused by construction works and road maintenance.",
     "Boroughs can use the new London Highways Alliance Contracts (LoHAC) to avoid the need for each authority to separately appoint contractors to undertake works.",
     "These are four area-based joint highway contracts awarded in November by TfL and the boroughs to reduce costs, provide consistency in the quality of works and materials and to minimise disruption.",
     "In addition, projects undertaken on main roads in the boroughs will be co-ordinated by TfL so that the method and timing of roadworks is managed to reduce their impact in the Capital and associated inconvenience and disruption to residents and road users.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE said: 'We are working in partnership with Barking \u0026 Dagenham and with all the London boroughs to bring real improvements to communities across the city.",
     "'The borough will be using this investment to fund hundreds of projects that will benefit all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians.",
     "'Public squares and local shopping areas will be rejuvenated, attracting more people to the area to boost the local economy.'",
     "Last year, Barking \u0026 Dagenham used their LIP funding towards 157 cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 933 children and 125 adults, the removal of 100 metres of guardrail, 20 new street trees and for 23 schools to participate in walking events.",
     "Notable larger projects this year undertaken in Barking \u0026 Dagenham include the completion of the Barking Station forecourt improvements, formally opened in June this year that received a £500,000 investment (in 2011 /12) to provide better access and safety.",
     "Notes to editors:",
     "Each borough produces a LIP to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.",
     "While individual transport projects are the responsibility of each borough."
