     "Transport for London (TfL) has allocated the money through Local Implementation Plan (LIP) funding for the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy.",
     "The funding is awarded to support projects in the London boroughs that will make cycling safer and easier, improve walking facilities, make roads safer, smooth traffic flow and breathe new life into town centres, public squares and local shopping areas to boost the local economy.",
     "The £5.6m funding package in 2013/14 will finance a range of transport projects in Bromley, including:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"£820,000 to tackle congestion at a number of hot-spots across the borough including Sevenoaks Way, modifying traffic signals with works also in Beckenham and Bromley Town Centres.  Other measures will include smoothing traffic flow and improving safety for all road users\",\"£128,000 to support the Bromley Area Action Plan that aims to give Bromley Town Centre and other local shopping streets a much needed lift and a boost to local businesses and traders\",\"£347,000 to make cycling safer and easier in the borough. Measures will include cycle training for adults and children, improved cycle parking  and cycle paths and  the development and promotion of off-road links\",\"£2m for Bromley North Village renewal and public realm improvements\"]}",
     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said:  'This funding will benefit all of London and everyone living in, working in or visiting Bromley.",
     "'A world class city deserves a world class transport system and the borough will use this money to make significant improvements for local people.'",
     "This year, two new measures have been introduced which will help the boroughs to drive down their costs, deliver value for money and minimise the disruption caused by construction works and road maintenance.",
     "Boroughs can use the new London Highways Alliance Contracts (LoHAC) to avoid the need for each authority to separately appoint contractors to undertake works.",
     "These are four area-based joint highway contracts awarded in November by TfL and the boroughs to reduce costs, provide consistency in the quality of works and materials and to minimise disruption.",
     "In addition, projects undertaken on main roads in the boroughs will be co-ordinated by TfL so that the method and timing of roadworks is managed to reduce their impact in the capital and associated inconvenience and disruption to residents and road users.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE said:  'We are working in partnership with Bromley and with all the London boroughs to bring real improvements to communities across the city.",
     "'The borough will be using this investment to fund hundreds of projects that will benefit all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians.",
     "'Public squares and local shopping areas will be rejuvenated, attracting more people to the area to boost the local economy.'",
     "Last year in Bromley, it funded 279 cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 2,319 children and 234 adults, five improved pedestrian crossings and walking events  in which 76 schools participated.",
     "Notable larger projects undertaken in Bromley this year include the completion of the reconstruction of Chislehurst Road Bridge which received £4.5 million funding and was delivered on time and on budget.",
