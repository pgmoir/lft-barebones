     "The funding is awarded to support projects in the London boroughs that will make cycling safer and easier, improve walking facilities, make roads safer, smooth traffic flow and breathe new life into town centres, public squares and local shopping areas to boost the local economy.",
     "The £3.5m funding package in 2013/14 will finance a range of projects in Kingston including:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"£1,385,000 for improvements to Tolworth Broadway. Works will include improving pedestrian crossings, decluttering footways, changing loading and parking arrangements to improve traffic access as well improving cycle parking facilities.

     "'A world class city deserves a world class transport system and the borough will use this money to make significant improvements for local people.'",
     "This year, two new measures have been introduced which will help the boroughs to drive down their costs, deliver value for money and minimise the disruption caused by construction works and road maintenance.",
     "Boroughs can use the new London Highways Alliance Contracts (LoHAC) to avoid the need for each authority to separately appoint contractors to undertake works.",
     "These are four area-based joint highway contracts awarded in November by TfL and the boroughs to reduce costs, provide consistency in the quality of works and materials and to minimise disruption.",
     "In addition, projects undertaken on main roads in the boroughs will be coordinated by TfL so that the method and timing of roadworks is managed to reduce their impact in the Capital and associated inconvenience and disruption to residents and road users.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE said: 'We are working in partnership with Kingston and with all the London boroughs to bring real improvements to communities across the city.",
     "'The borough will be using this investment to fund hundreds of projects that will benefit all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians.",
     "'Public squares and local shopping areas will be rejuvenated, attracting more people to the area to boost the local economy.'",

     "Notable larger projects undertaken this year in Kingston include improvements to  Ewell Road, which received £250,000 to improve bus lanes, parking and loading, pedestrian crossings and public realm improvements at the shopping parades.",
