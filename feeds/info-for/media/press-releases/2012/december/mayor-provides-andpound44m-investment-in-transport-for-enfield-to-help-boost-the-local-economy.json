     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson has today announced £4.4m for Enfield to invest in transport projects that will benefit the local community.",
     "TfL has allocated the money through Local Implementation Plan (LIP) funding for the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy.",
     "The funding is awarded to support projects in the London boroughs that will make cycling safer and easier, improve walking facilities, make roads safer, smooth traffic flow and breathe new life into town centres, public squares and local shopping areas to boost the local economy.",
     "The £4.4m funding package in 2013/14 will finance a range of transport projects in Enfield, including:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"£600,000 to convert roads to 20mph around 15 schools within the borough to improve road safety and to encourage pupils to walk and cycle to school\",\"£70,000 to implement a strategy to deliver cycling improvements in the borough\",\"£150,000 for a Bus Stop Accessibility programme, to ensure bus stops across the borough are easy to use and accessible for all\"]}",
     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: 'This funding will benefit all of London and everyone living in, working in or visiting Enfield.",
     "'A world-class city deserves a world-class transport system and the borough will use this money to make significant improvements for local people.'",

     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Local investment\"}",
     "Boroughs can use the new London Highways Alliance Contracts (LoHAC) to avoid the need for each authority to separately appoint contractors to undertake works.",
     "These are four area-based joint highway contracts awarded in November by TfL and the boroughs to reduce costs, provide consistency in the quality of works and materials and to minimise disruption.",
     "In addition, projects undertaken on main roads in the boroughs will be co-ordinated by TfL so that the method and timing of roadworks is managed to reduce their impact in the Capital and associated inconvenience and disruption to residents and road users.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE said: 'We are working in partnership with Enfield and with all the London boroughs to bring real improvements to communities across the city.",
     "'The borough will be using this investment to fund hundreds of projects that will benefit all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians.",

     "Last year in Enfield, it funded cycle training for  2,139 children and adults, 178 education sessions using theatre to increase awareness of road safety and sustainable travel, for 111 schools to participate in walking promotions including Walk on Wednesdays and Walk to School Week and 480 new street trees.",
     "Notable larger projects underway in Enfield already include four Greenways schemes that received £500,000 which will be ready in spring 2013.",
