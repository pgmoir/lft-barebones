     "The £4.4m funding package in 2013/14 will finance a range of transport projects in Haringey, including:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"£500,000 for regeneration improvements along the Green Lanes corridor.

     "'A world class city deserves a world class transport system and the borough will use this money to make significant improvements for local people.'",
     "This year, two new measures have been introduced which will help the boroughs to drive down their costs, deliver value for money and minimise the disruption caused by construction works and road maintenance.",
     "Boroughs can use the new London Highways Alliance Contracts (LoHAC) to avoid the need for each authority to separately appoint contractors to undertake works.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Local investment\"}",
     "These are four area-based joint highway contracts awarded in November by TfL and the boroughs to reduce costs, provide consistency in the quality of works and materials and to minimise disruption.",
     "In addition, projects undertaken on main roads in the boroughs will be co-ordinated by TfL so that the method and timing of roadworks is managed to reduce their impact in the Capital and associated inconvenience and disruption to residents and road users.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE said: 'We are working in partnership with Haringey and with all the London boroughs to bring real improvements to communities across the city.",

     "The project is currently being designed and consulted upon with implementation expected to start summer 2013.",
