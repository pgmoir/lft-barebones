     "The group, the first of its kind in the UK, is made up of senior representatives from City Hall, TfL, London Councils and the six biggest utility companies.",
     "It follows on from the Mayor's meeting with the CEOs of the six major utility companies late last year.",
     "Together, they have agreed new, specific targets to work towards by the end of the year.",
     "These include initiatives within their own businesses such as an increase in joint working and shorter work durations, which will help ensure that any disruption to Londoners is kept to a minimum.",
     "As part of this work, all utility companies have agreed to work with TfL to share knowledge of good practice and explore innovative working methods such as quick curing materials and innovative 'core and vac' technology which would allow work to be carried out under the carriageway without the need to dig up the road.",
     "They will also work with all London boroughs to support a more consistent approach to providing permitting information and meeting environmental health requirements.",
     "Work has also begun to update the Mayor's Voluntary Code of Conduct for Roadworks.",
     "The code, which was launched in April 2009 and has been adopted by TfL, 20 London boroughs and six major utility companies, looks to promote good practice and encourage more coordinated working between utilities and highway authorities.",
     "The revised version, which is due to be published in March 2012, will see specific targets introduced to ensure that the measures set out in the code can be properly benchmarked and, if necessary, enforced, helping to drive further improvement across the capital.",

     "'Having close working relationships with the most senior people in the 'big 6' utilities means we can deliver a step-change in further reducing the number and impact of road works. Our first joint action will be producing a tighter Code of Conduct for roadworks within the next few weeks.'",
     "Garrett Emmerson, Chief Operating Officer for Surface Transport at TfL said 'I am delighted that we had a really positive working meeting, with a great deal of enthusiasm around the table to get to grips with the issues that frustrate Londoners the most, including poor signage, overly long works durations, no-one working on site and lack of coordination requiring repeat visits to the same area.'",
     "Malcolm Russell, Director of Operations for Southern Gas Networks said: 'We are all committed to working closely with TfL and each other going forward, to ensure minimum disruption is caused while we provide these essential services safely and efficiently, to keep London working.'",
     "Over the same time-frame, there was a 13 per cent reduction in the number of overall roadworks.",
     "This is a result of joint working with the boroughs and utility companies, the introduction of the roadworks permitting scheme which has been embraced by every London borough, a reduction in the roadworks cap which restricts the number of works that can be carried out at any one time, and thousands of reports using the Report It system which enables Londoners to name and shame bad practice.",

The charges would apply to key areas of the major road network and would incentivise companies to work more efficiently and at less disruptive times. Both TfL and the Mayor hope to have the scheme up and running in the Capital during 2012\"]}"
