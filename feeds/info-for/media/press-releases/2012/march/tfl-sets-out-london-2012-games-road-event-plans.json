     "After the events, barriers will need to be removed, road signs, traffic lights and islands reinstated, roads thoroughly cleaned and crowds dispersed before roads can be re-opened safely.",
     "The majority of road events will be held at weekends and some competitions will only take place for a few hours beginning in the morning.",
