     "Overall, the number of teenagers killed or seriously injured has fallen by almost 62 per cent since the campaign started in 2000.",
     "Ben Plowden, Director of Planning, Surface Transport at TfL said: 'Transport for London is committed to reducing the number of teenage road casualties.",
     "'The new posters address the many distractions teenagers may face while nearby or using the road. This is an important part of our ongoing work to save lives, the campaign builds on the success of previous years with the number of casualties falling every year.'",
     "The ideas behind the campaign are a result of in-depth research into teenage behaviour, which has won an award from the Market Research Society.",
     "The work is part of TfL's ongoing commitment to reach young people in ways are relevant to them.",
