     "London Underground is heading for its most reliable year since TfL took responsibility for the Tube a decade ago, with passenger numbers soaring and average delays at their lowest since 2003/04 according to the latest performance figures for the Tube.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eToday (2 March) the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, attributed the improvement in performance to measures that his team has introduced, working closely with London Undergound's top engineers and other officials.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe latest figures cover a four-week period between 11 December 2011 and 7 January 2012 and demonstrate how so far this year London Underground is delivering its most reliable performance ever when compared to previous years.",
     "The Tube now looks set to end the year with the lowest average for delays - as measured by the number of customer hours lost to disruption - since the measurement began in 1999, and across the network lost customers hours have been reduced by almost 40 per cent since 2007/08.",

     "The Tube reliability programme introduced last year and overseen by the Mayor has helped to deliver the clear improvements in performance.",
     "The Mayor's team are regularly attending 'war room' meetings to tackle the top five issues and draw up plans to improve services.",
     "The group is run by top London Underground officials who have been working to find solutions to problems which affect reliability of services, examples of which include work to tackle accidental false alarm calls by passengers and work to improve the performance of the train fleet.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'London could not function without decent public transport and alongside the investment in future capacity and reliability it is vital that we continuously improve the service experience for Londoners.",

     "That includes advanced signal monitoring technology that helps indicate potential failure, and Automated Track Monitoring Systems, which automatically identify any track related defects and allow maintenance activities to be planned to minimise disruption to passengers.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Blue light status\"}",
     "London Underground is increasing its incident response capabilities, and developing plans to co-locate engineering and operations staff in one command and control centre so it can speed up the time it takes to recover from incidents.",
     "It is also working closely with the British Transport Police (BTP) on a system where the BTP help get TfL's Emergency Response Unit swiftly to any incidents on the Underground under blue light status.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCustomer information around service alterations is being improved, and staff training given an increased focus on keeping customers informed.",
