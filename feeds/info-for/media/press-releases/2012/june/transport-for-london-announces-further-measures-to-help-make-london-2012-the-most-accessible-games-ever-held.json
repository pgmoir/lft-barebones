     "London remains on track to deliver the most accessible Games ever held as Transport for London (TfL) announced the final stage in a programme which has seen hundreds of millions of pounds invested in making the transport network in London more accessible.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eDisabled people intending to travel in London during the Games - and after them - now have improved online resources available to help them plan.Â A series of short 'how to' films have been created to help disabled people unfamiliar with London's public transport system use TfL's ticketing and journey planning systems, buses, the Tube, DLR and taxis.",
     "The films, one of which is narrated by Paralympic legend and TfL board member, Baroness Grey-Thompson DBE, are available now at tfl.gov.uk/mobility.",
     "In addition, TfL's journey planner has also been upgraded to make it easier to plan step-free journeys online.",

     "The manual boarding ramps will enable wheelchair users to board trains more easily at these stations, which have a gap between the train and the platform. If the use of the temporary ramps proves popular TfL will look to see how their use can be extended beyond the Games.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs with London Underground's existing assistance service for visually-impaired passengers, it won't be necessary to pre-book use of the ramps. When requested, Tube staff at the departure station will call ahead to the destination station to ensure that a ramp and member of staff will be waiting for them.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMike Brown, Managing Director of London Underground, said: 'The new 'how to' films we've launched today, our improved online accessible journey planning and the use of manual boarding ramps are part of our ongoing efforts to improve accessibility on London's transport network.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e'People travelling around London during Games-time will discover that we have an entirely accessible bus and taxi fleet, step-free access across the Docklands Light Railway network and step-free access at all new London Overground stations.",
     "'By the start of the Games 66 Tube stations will also be step-free.

That will make it a tremendously exciting place to be, and to get out and explore, this summer but people need to bear in mind that roads and the public transport network in central London and around venues will, at times, be exceptionally busy.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e'Just as the athletes themselves have planned their training for the Games, I urge everyone to start thinking and planning their travel needs around Games time and to 'Get Ahead of the Games' whether they are heading off to an Olympic or Paralympic event, work or meeting up with friends.",
     "'The new resources TfL has announced today will make this summer's Games accessible to everyone, regardless of whether they are disabled or not.'\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTransport for London has invested hundreds of millions of pounds in making the transport network more accessible in the last few years, with improvements such as new lifts, trains, platform humps, wide aisle gates, tactile paving and audio-visual displays.",
     "A total of 66 stations will be step-free by the Games, all Tube stations have staff trained to assist passengers, and every station on the DLR is step-free.",
     "London's bus fleet is the most accessible fleet in the world - with all 8,500 buses low-floor wheelchair accessible and fitted with ramps which are checked daily to ensure they are working. All 22,000 taxis are fitted with wheelchair ramps, and all piers and most boats in London are accessible. Other final improvements that have been delivered already, or will be in place in time for the Games, include:",

These services will be free for blue badge holders or members of national equivalent scheme.
