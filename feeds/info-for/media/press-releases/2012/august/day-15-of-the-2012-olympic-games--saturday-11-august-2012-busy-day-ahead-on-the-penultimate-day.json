     "Today will be another action-packed day of cultural and sporting events, with action taking place across the city, with Race Walks in central London, football in Wembley and spectators travelling between Greenwich Park and the Olympic Park to watch Modern Pentathlon and Diving events.",
     "This comes as the transport network continues to serve record numbers of passengers as Londoners and visitors make the most of London's attractions. Thursday saw a record 4.52m Tube journeys - the highest number in the Tube's history. Over the 13 days of the Olympic period starting Saturday 28 July, London Underground carried 51.47m passengers - an increase of 12.29m (31.4 per cent) compared with the same period last year.",
     "Today's men's Race Walk starts at 09:00 and finishes at 13:00 with the women's Race Walk starting at 17:00 and finishing at 19:00. This will mean that areas around Constitution Hill, Buckingham Palace and The Mall will be exceptionally busy.",
     "Public transport to and from Olympic venues will be very busy and people should plan ahead. As some events continue into the evening spectators are reminded to check times of their last train home and non-spectators are urged to continue avoiding the busiest stations at the busiest times. To plan journeys visit \u003ca href=\"http://www.GetAheadoftheGames.com\"\u003eGetAheadoftheGames.com\u003c/a\u003e .",

There are a number of stations that can be used to access the Hyde Park Live Site including Bond Street, Marble Arch and Green Park. Marble Arch and Hyde Park stations will operate flexibly and may become exit-only if they are busy. Victoria Park can be accessed from Mile End station.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE, said: 'It is hard to believe that today is the penultimate day of London 2012 Olympic Games. London will once again see a day of invigorating sporting events, and the Jubilee and Metropolitan lines will be like a fiesta as Brazilian and Mexican football fans make their way to Wembley to watch the final.",
     "'We're incredibly grateful to Londoners for adapting their travel patterns throughout the Olympics. By travelling outside peak times or taking different routes, it's made a huge contribution to ensuring the success of the Games and keeping London moving. With these efforts, the Tube has been able to carry record numbers of passengers - 4.52m people on Thursday. We need our passengers to continue to keep this sensible planning going, avoiding the busiest times and places, as we enter the Paralympics in just 19 days time.",
     "'This summer presents a huge wealth of opportunities spanning sport and culture and Londoners and visitors should take advantage of the many theatres, restaurants, shops, free concerts, Live Sites and attractions that the Capital has to offer. The Race Walks in central London will be exciting to watch, as will the sailing in Weymouth, so I would urge people to use \u003ca href=\"http://www.getaheadofthegames.com/\"\u003eGetAheadoftheGames.com\u003c/a\u003e to plan their journeys to Games events, wherever in London or the UK the Games venue is.'",
     "Looking ahead to Sunday's Closing Ceremony, Westfield Stratford City shopping centre will, after 8pm, only be accessible to accredited workers and members of the public with or collecting Games tickets or attending hospitality venues and people with reservations at venues within the shopping centre. All other passengers should avoid the shopping centre at that time and enjoy the shopping and attractions at the numerous other locations across London.",
