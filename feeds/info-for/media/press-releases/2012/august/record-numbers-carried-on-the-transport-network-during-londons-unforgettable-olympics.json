     "Tomorrow, Monday 13 August, will see one of Heathrow Airport's busiest days as athletes, coaching staff, representatives, international media and officials head home. This will mean that certain roads and Tube stations will be busy and passengers and road users are encouraged to avoid the affected areas.

However, the ORN will still be operating in central London and road users should avoid the ORN where possible. If you have to drive, plan ahead, consider re-timing your journey and allow more time.",

Record numbers have also been seen on  the DLR, London Overground, Barclays Cycle Hire and the Emirates Air Line.",
     "'We are really grateful to Londoners for adapting their travel patterns this summer.  On Monday our roads and transport network will still be busier than usual so I'd urge Londoners to continue to take our advice and plan ahead.",
     "Also, in just two weeks time we host the world's second biggest sporting event, the Paralympic Games, and I'd encourage Londoners to start planning now  to avoid the busiest stations at the busiest times.'",
