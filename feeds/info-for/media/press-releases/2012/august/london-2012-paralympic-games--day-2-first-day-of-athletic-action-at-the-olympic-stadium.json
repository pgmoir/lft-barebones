     "Spectators heading to or from the Olympic Park are being asked to consider using C2C, District and Hammersmith \u0026 City lines to or from West Ham and to access the Park via the Greenway.",
     "This will help avoid the crowds. Passengers with reduced mobility should use Stratford station, where assistance is available.",
     "National rail services between Liverpool Street and Stratford should also be considered.",
     "All passengers are advised to leave extra travel time and to plan ahead to avoid the busiest times and places by visiting: \u003ca href=\"http://www.GetAheadoftheGames.com\"\u003ewww.GetAheadoftheGames.com\u003c/a\u003e .",

The Jubilee and Central lines will be very busy from central London to Stratford, as well as Javelin and DLR services.",
     "`Roads near venues and approaching the City are also busier than normal and this is likely to increase as Londoners and their children return to work and school following the summer holidays.  We are therefore asking people take the same sensible steps they did during the Olympics and avoid driving around venues and the PRN.  Plan ahead and avoid the busiest times and places where possible, by checking at GetAheadoftheGames.com.'",
