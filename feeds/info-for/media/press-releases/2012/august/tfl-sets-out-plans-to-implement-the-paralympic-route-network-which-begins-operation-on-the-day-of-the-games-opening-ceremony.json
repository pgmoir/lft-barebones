     "Transport for London (TfL) today set out the detailed plans for the implementation and operation of the Paralympic Route Network (PRN) and provided important advice for motorists in the run-up to and during the Paralympic Games, which take place from 29 August until 9 September.",
     "As the Capital gets ready to welcome the world to London again, and to hosting the best ever Paralympic Games, roads around the Olympic Park, the City and the east of London will start becoming busier from early next week.",
     "The PRN preparation works, taking place overnight to keep disruption to a minimum, will start on Saturday (25 August).",
     "By Tuesday 28 August final preparations, such as placing barriers to restrict turning manoeuvres across the PRN, will be put in place in time for it to begin operation and for the Games lanes in London to be enforced from 06:00 on Wednesday 29 August, the day of the Paralympic Games Opening Ceremony.",
     "The PRN will help ensure all athletes, officials and the world's media can get to events on time during the Games.",
     "The 36 mile-long PRN is considerably smaller than the Olympic Route Network (ORN) and is focused on the east of London.",
     "There are 8.7 miles of Games lanes on the routes between the City of London financial district, where the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and the world's media will be based, the Olympic Park and other venues, including ExCeL, North Greenwich Arena, Greenwich Park and the Royal Artillery Barracks.",
     "There is an additional Games lane between junctions 3 and 2 of the eastbound M4, which is operated by the Highways Agency.",
     "As during the Olympic Games, the Games lanes will be operated flexibly and will be opened up to all traffic when demand from Paralympic Games vehicles is low and capacity is available.",
     "A network of around 100 Variable Message Signs (VMS) along the PRN will clearly state to drivers that they may continue to use the road network as normal and that they are not restricted from using the lanes marked out with the Olympic rings symbols until operation of the PRN begins on 29 August and when open to all traffic during the Games.",
