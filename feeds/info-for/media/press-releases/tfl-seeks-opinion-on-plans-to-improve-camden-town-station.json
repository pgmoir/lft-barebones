     "A public consultation is now underway on Transport for London's (TfL's) proposals to modernise and radically improve the capacity of Camden Town station.",
     "The proposed upgrade would see the station treble in size, with the construction of a new entrance on Buck Street, that features three new escalators and greater space for customers using the four Northern line platforms.  The station will also be made step-free, vastly improving access to the vibrant Camden area. The new measures would create a more spacious station, making customer journeys more comfortable, particularly during the busiest periods.",
     "With over 30 million customers using the station each year Camden Town is already one of the busiest interchanges on the Underground. The number of passengers using the station is expected to rise by 40 per cent by 2021, and the original station - designed in 1907 - needs to be upgraded to cope with the increased, and growing, demand. Crowd control measures, including making the station exit only, are regularly used as a means of easing congestion and ensuring safety.",
     "Mark Wild, Managing Director of London Underground, said:",
     "'Upgrading Camden Town Tube station will improve journeys for the tens of thousands of customers who use the station every day. The first consultation we held demonstrated overwhelming support for a station upgrade and we are now seeking views on our more detailed plans. We want to significantly improve journeys through Camden by giving customers a modern step-free station that is more spacious, accessible and equipped to support growing demand and the growing number of homes and jobs in the area.'",
     "In the first public consultation, 95 per cent of the 1,700 respondents agreed that the station needs an upgrade. This consultation will seek the public's opinion over updated proposals to increase the capacity of the station.",
     "Notes to Editors:",
