     "dots take many forms from simple tables, to customised vans, trucks, carts and bikes.",
     "The partnership aims to liberate traders from the hassle involved in finding a pitch, while introducing customers to new brands. Traders use a smartphone app to choose a 'dot' for a few hours at a time.",
     "For example, a coffee truck might book a morning slot outside of a Tube station during peak commuting hours. In turn, customers passing the same 'dot' regularly get the chance to discover new businesses and products each day.",

     "'When we started our business, we just worked at weekend events, but our coffee was becoming so popular that I gave up my day job and used StreetDots to start selling it in the week.'",
     "Another business trialling TfL dots is Zip and Zing Juices, which sells organic smoothies and slow-pressed juices.",
     "Owner Antony Cervantes decided to turn his interest in juicing into a business in 2016 following voluntary redundancy. A custom-made juice trike was the obvious vehicle of choice for the keen cyclist.",
     "Antony Cervantes said: 'There are so many good things about having a mobile stall. I love cycling to events or pitches and it's fun to hear pedestrians shout my company name as I ride past.",

     "'It is another great example of how we are supporting small businesses alongside generating vital revenue to reinvest in the transport network.'",
     "Atholl Milton, StreetDots co-founder, said: 'Since we opened our first dot in 2014, the StreetDots network has helped over 300 street food traders tour their trucks, vans and stalls around London, collecting new customers in each new area they visit.",
