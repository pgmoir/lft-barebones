     "All 41 stations on the Elizabeth line will have step-free access when the new railway is fully open in December 2019. This is in addition to the Mayor's target for 40% of the London Underground network to be step-free by 2022.",

     "The station improvements will include new lifts and footbridges to Elizabeth line platforms. TfL will also be constructing a brand new station building at Iver, replacing the current structure that dates back to the 1920s.",

     "Paul Maynard, rail and accessibility minister, said: 'Transport for London is making excellent progress to ensure all stations are step-free as part of our investment to revolutionise London's transport network and improve access for millions of passengers.",

     "TfL will ensure all stations are deep-cleaned ahead of other improvements such as refurbished waiting rooms and toilets and the installation of new ticket machines and ticket gates. Work will begin in 2018 and is due to be complete by late 2019.",
     "These upgrades are part of TfL's work to improve stations on the western section of the Elizabeth line route by the end of 2019 when the new railway will be fully operational linking Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and west London with the West End, east London and Essex.",
     "Network Rail is also working to deliver step-free access and upgrades at six stations in the west between West Drayton and Acton Main Line.",
     "Once fully open in December 2019, customers from Reading and Heathrow will be able to travel through central London to the West End and the City without needing to change trains.
