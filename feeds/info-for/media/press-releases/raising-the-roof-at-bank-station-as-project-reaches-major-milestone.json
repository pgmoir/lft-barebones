     "A landmark moment in the project to upgrade Bank Tube station was reached this week, with the roof on the new station entrance, located on Cannon Street, 'topped out' and now complete.",
     "The new entrance will provide customers with direct access to the Northern line, as well as connecting a new moving walkway to the Central line.",
     "The upgrade of Bank station, due for completion in 2022, will boost capacity at the busy interchange by 40%.",
     "Work will now continue to fit out the entrance, with the next stage focused on creating the dividing walls and operational rooms within the new station entrance, which is spread across 11 storeys.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Landmark moment\"}",
     "The remaining tunnelling is progressing well, with the southbound platform already under construction in the new Northern line running tunnel, and the construction of the new escalator barrel to the DLR due to commence in early Autumn.",
     "The project, which passed the halfway mark earlier this year, will eventually provide two new lifts at the Cannon Street entrance, 12 new escalators and two moving walkways.",
     "These additions will make access to the Northern line step-free and improve the existing step-free access to the DLR.",
     "Stuart Harvey, TfL's Major Projects Director, said: 'Bank Tube station is one of the busiest on the Tube network, with over 120 million customers using it every year.",
     "'Once complete, the upgrade will make journeys through the station quicker and more comfortable for everyone, providing greater capacity at this vitally important interchange.'"
