     "Transport for London (TfL) and Croydon Council have published proposals to make Fiveways in Waddon simpler and safer for all road users.",
     "This proposed major improvement would provide a safer and more direct route for road users through the area while helping to reduce delays and congestion. The area would be made more welcoming with easier and safer pedestrian access across the A23 Purley Way and more than 300m of new segregated cycle track. The changes would also improve bus journey times - delivering a better service on routes moving more than 9,000 passengers a day.",
     "Nigel Hardy, TfL's Head of Sponsorship, Road Space Management, said: `We want to transform Fiveways to make it safer, more efficient and improve the look and feel of the area. This will all help to support growth in the area and its local economy.",
     "`Our proposals would improve pedestrian, cycle safety and accessibility while reducing congestion. We've listened to the feedback from our initial consultation to help ensure we are balancing the needs of everyone and are now seeking views on these more detailed plans.'",
     "Councillor Stuart King, Cabinet Member for Transport and Environment said: `Frequent users of the A23 Purley Way will know how busy Fiveways can be - particularly during rush hour. This proposal will lead to a reduction in congestion and traffic, as well as making the area safer and more accessible for cyclists and pedestrians.",
     "`I'd encourage everyone, especially those directly affected, to attend the public exhibitions to learn more about the plans, share their views and help shape the way we transform this busy area of our town.'",
     "The transformation of Fiveways is part of plans to improve Waddon, which will ensure improvements to the road network - including reducing congestion and improving accessibility for all transport users - is coordinated with public space and green spaces, along with opportunities for development. The Fiveways area is extremely busy with motorists and bus users frequently experiencing congestion at peak times - especially on weekends when large numbers of visitors go to and from the popular retail parks along Purley Way.",
     "TfL held a public consultation on two proposals addressing congestion and improving the area for residents, pedestrians and cyclists in 2015. This consultation demonstrated strong local desire for a change in how the road operates - with 81 per cent of respondents supporting or partially supporting the principle of a road improvement scheme at Fiveways.",
     "The proposals include:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Widening, replacing and future-proofing the A23 Purley Way bridge that crosses the railway by Waddon station\",\"Creating a new public space at Fiveways Corner\",\"Increasing, upgrading and simplifying pedestrians crossings on the A23 Purley Way and Epsom Road to make walking easier in the area\",\"Creating more than 300m of segregated cycle track on Epsom Road, with access to Waddon station\",\"Diverting Denning Avenue directly onto the A23, which would remove a traffic signal phase at the junction resulting in shorter wait times for traffic\"]}",
     "The views of residents and users of Fiveways Croydon are crucial to ensure that the best possible improvement is made. TfL and Croydon Council are holding five public exhibitions at Waddon Leisure Centre and one at St George's Church Centre to better inform the public of the plans.",
     "The consultation opens today and runs until Monday 18 September 2017. For more information on, and to respond to, the plans go to: \u003ca href=\"http://tfl.gov.uk/fiveways-croydon\"\u003etfl.gov.uk/fiveways-croydon\u003c/a\u003e ",
