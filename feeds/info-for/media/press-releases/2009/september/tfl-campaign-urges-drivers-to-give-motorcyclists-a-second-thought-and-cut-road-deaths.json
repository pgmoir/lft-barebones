     "This campaign will make the roads safer for any Londoner wishing to make the switch to two wheels",
     "Transport for London (TfL) has launched its latest campaign to cut the number of motorcyclists killed or injured on London's roads.",
     "Launching today, TfL's BikeSafe London team's TV campaign will run throughout the autumn, timed to coincide with the return to work of thousands of Londoners and a rise in the number of casualties among motorbike and scooter riders.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"The optical effect\"}",
     "The TV ads, created by renowned designer Peter Saville, highlight an optical effect that psychologists believe could put motorcyclists at risk, and the campaign urges drivers to 'give motorcyclists a second thought', particularly when making right turns.",
     "The optical effect is caused by the way the brain assesses approaching objects.",
     "Drivers can underestimate the time that small vehicles take to reach them - causing risk of collision when pulling out in front of approaching motorcycles.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Commuters at risk\"}",
     "Riders commuting to work are a vulnerable group, with the majority of casualties occurring in the morning or evening.",
     "Last year there were 4,890 collisions in Greater London involving motorcycles and/or scooters with other road users.",
     "Of these collisions 848 resulted in a death or serious injury and 94 per cent occurred on roads subject to a 30mph speed limit.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Safer roads\"}",
     "Chris Lines, Head of the London Road Safety Unit at TfL, said:",
     "'This optical illusion campaign highlights just one of the ways in which drivers can come into contact with motorcyclists.",
     "'Drivers should look out for motorcyclists in all situations, especially during the commuting hours, when a high proportion of collisions occur.",
     "'Encouraging the use of bikes, whether they are the powered or pedal variety, is important to reduce congestion and keep London moving.",
     "'Hopefully this campaign will encourage more considerate riding and make the roads safer for any Londoner wishing to make the switch to two wheels.'",
