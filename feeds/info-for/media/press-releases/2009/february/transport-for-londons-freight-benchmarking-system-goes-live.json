     "Transport for London's (TfL's) Freight Operator Recognition Scheme (FORS) benchmarking system has now gone live and freight operators are using it to compare their performance with that of similar operators working in the Capital.",
     "FORS is a unique industry-led membership scheme that offers practical advice and guidance to freight operators in London to improve all areas of freight distribution, including helping them drive down costs and become safer and more environmentally-focused drivers.",
     "The benchmarking system, which is available online, allows FORS members to anonymously and instantly compare their performance and costs with those of other London freight operators in fuel use, carbon dioxide emissions, collisions and fines and charges.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Comparing performance\"}",
     "Benchmarking will help operators improve their performance over time against these criteria and allow them to demonstrate this to their existing and potential customers.",
     "The benchmarking system was designed for TfL by Faber Maunsell and integrates with the Department for Transport's (DfT) national on-line benchmarking system.",
     "It is one of the many benefits that are available with FORS membership.",
     "Glen Davies, TfL's FORS Project Director, said: 'FORS is the future of freight in London.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Free scheme\"}",
     "'The benchmarking initiative is an important addition to help operators progress in the scheme and complements the range of benefits already in place that are designed to encourage and support freight operators to more effectively and efficiently contribute to the sustainable development of London.'",
     "Freight operators interested in using and benefiting from the benchmarking scheme need to become members of FORS, which is free and open to all van and lorry operators delivering in and around London.",
     "Since the scheme started last year, almost 170 freight operators have registered, with more than 20,000 vehicles.",
     "Eighty of these operators are now accredited to bronze level.",
     "For more information on the scheme, or for membership details, operators should visit \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/fors\"\u003etfl.gov.uk/fors\u003c/a\u003e ",
