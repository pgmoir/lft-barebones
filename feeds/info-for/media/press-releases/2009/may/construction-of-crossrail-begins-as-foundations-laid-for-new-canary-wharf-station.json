Crossrail will provide new transport links with the Tube, Thameslink, National Rail, DLR and London Overground. It is anticipated that over 200 million passengers will use Crossrail in the first year of operation\",\"Crossrail will deliver a significant economic benefit of at least £20bn to the UK economy following the start of services in 2017. A recent economic study for Crossrail by Colin Buchanan consultants found that all boroughs in London, not just those on the Crossrail route, will benefit economically. When the results are modelled for just one year - 2026 - the annual economic benefit across all of London's boroughs is estimated at £1.24bn at 2008 prices\",\"The scale of Crossrail is of a size and scale not seen for decades. It enables the renewal of key stations in central London with nine new stations built underground in central London, Docklands and Woolwich as well as eleven major reconstructions of national rail stations along the route.

The station is covered by an elegant, semi open-air timber lattice roof allowing views out over the dock, Canary Wharf and beyond\",\"To enable construction of the station box, 396 steel piles measuring 18.5 metres high and 1.2 metres wide will be sunk into the dock floor using 10 storey high piling cranes and Giken Piling machines. This is the first time this type of machinery has been used in the UK, although it is extensively used in Japan. The Giken piling is expected to be completed by October this year. Water will then be pumped out of the piled structure to enable a concrete wall to be built as part of the next stage of construction\",\"North Quay will be the worksite for the new Crossrail station at Canary Wharf. The station box is expected to be completed and handed over to Crossrail by summer 2012.
