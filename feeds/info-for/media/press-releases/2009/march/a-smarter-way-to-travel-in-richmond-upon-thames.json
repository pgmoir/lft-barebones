     "Transport for London (TfL) and the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames have joined forces to launch Smarter Travel Richmond, a three year, £4.2million initiative to help people change the way they travel in the borough.",
     "The scheme aims to encourage greater use of sustainable travel options, such as walking, cycling or using public transport, as well as reducing traffic congestion and improving the local environment.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Greener travel options\"}",
     "TfL and Richmond Council will make greener travel options more easily available in the borough through a range of new facilities and projects, including:",

     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'Despite its leafy image, Richmond faces the same challenges in terms of congestion and air pollution as other parts of London.",
     "'This scheme will help make Richmond upon Thames an even greener, healthier place for people to live and work.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Cut carbon dioxide emissions\"}",
     "'It will also contribute towards cutting the Capital's carbon dioxide emissions, which we intend to reduce by 60 per cent by 2025, and will help set the standard for boosting cycling and walking in the outer boroughs.",
     "'I can imagine nothing better than cycling through parts of Richmond, but this will mean that people across the borough will find it much easier to take to two wheels.'",
     "Peter Hendy, London's Transport Commissioner, said: 'Smarter Travel Richmond is all about providing people with the tools they need to feel confident about walking, cycling and using public transport.",
     "'That might include information on public transport and car club services, for example, or it could be cycle training giving people the confidence to dust off their bikes and cycle to work or to the park at the weekend.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Most convenient options\"}",
     "'Cycling, walking or travelling by public transport are not just the greenest options - they're often the quickest, cheapest and most convenient options too.",
     "'The Smarter Travel programme has already proven to be hugely influential in Sutton and I look forward to seeing similar successes in Richmond upon Thames.'",
     "Richmond upon Thames Councillor David Trigg said: 'Whenever we carry out a survey of our residents, reducing traffic congestion and air pollution comes very high on people's priorities.",
     "'We think this project will strike a chord among very many of our residents who statistics also show to be among the most environmentally concerned in the Capital.",
     "'This is important because the one sure thing about the Smarter Travel Project is that Richmond Council and TfL will not achieve much on our own - we need the support of local people.'",
     "Richmond upon Thames currently has the second highest level of transport-related carbon dioxide emissions in the Capital, and 88 per cent of its residents find traffic to be a problem in the borough.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Greenest in London by 2012\"}",
     "Through the Smarter Travel programme, the borough aims to be the greenest in London by 2012.",
