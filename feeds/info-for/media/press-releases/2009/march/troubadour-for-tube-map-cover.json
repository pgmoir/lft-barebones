He became one of the founding members of the not-for-profit gallery City Racing in Kennington, which built a reputation as a supportive environment for artists.  His work explores themes of hopelessness and social malfunction, creating highly detailed, yet bleak and despairing, fantastical landscapes in graphite and paint.  The work in Noble's 2004 solo show at the Whitechapel Gallery, 'Nobson Newtown', took 8 years to complete, and included a series of large scale detailed aerial drawings of a fictional city. In 2007 he showed at the Gagosian Gallery in New York\",\"Art on the Underground is London Underground's art programme, producing high calibre artworks throughout the network, enhancing the millions of journeys made every day.
