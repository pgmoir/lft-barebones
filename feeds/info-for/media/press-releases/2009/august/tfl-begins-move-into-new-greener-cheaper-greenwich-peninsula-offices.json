     "A green 'living roof' has been installed to help boost the local ecology as well as improving insulation and limiting the flood impact from rainfall and even the kitchen work surfaces on each floor are made from recycled glass that originally started life as windows on the 1967 Victoria line Tube carriages.",
     "Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, said: 'I firmly believe that all companies across London should do their bit to ensure they are as energy efficient as possible.",

     "Staff from TfL's Human Resource and Financial Services departments are the first to move into the new building.",
     "The move to the Greenwich Peninsula also represents the second phase of TfL's long-term property strategy, which will deliver £100m in efficiency savings over the next 25 years.",
     "The first phase was completed in 2008 when TfL moved into Palestra in Southwark. The final phase of the strategy will be delivered in 2012, when TfL occupies a number of floors within the Shard of Glass building in London Bridge.",
