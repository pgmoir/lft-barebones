     "This scheme should make the area more pleasant and safer for pedestrians, cyclists, road users and the local community",
     "Transport for London (TfL) has begun a six week public consultation on proposed improvements to the road layout around Tottenham Hale.",
     "The proposals include:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Converting the gyratory system to two-way traffic\",\"Better facilities and access for pedestrians and cyclists\",\"Reduced volume of traffic on Broad Lane\",\"New larger bus station at Tottenham Hale station, and more convenient bus stops\",\"New public square at Tottenham Hale station\",\"Improved access to properties for residents and businesses.\"]}",
     "The existing one-way system in Tottenham Hale currently has high volumes of traffic and few pedestrian crossings.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Reduced traffic\"}",
     "The proposed scheme will look to reduce the impact of traffic on the local area while still allowing for potential future traffic growth from local developments.",
     "Dick Halle, Director of Strategy at TfL, said: 'TfL's transport plans for Tottenham Hale would create a new public square and a safer environment for pedestrians, cyclists, road users and the local community, and make a major contribution to the continued regeneration of the area.",
     "'As well as converting the gyratory to a two-way road system, the scheme would also provide a new, larger, more accessible bus station at Tottenham Hale.",
     "'More convenient bus stops, particularly at Seven Sisters station, and a range of cycling improvements for local residents are also key to the scheme.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Safer for pedestrians\"}",
     "Cllr Brian Haley, Cabinet Member for Environment and Conservation at Haringey Council, said: 'The existing one-way system has high volumes of traffic and few pedestrian crossings, creating a barrier to properties within the one way system.",
     "'This new scheme should make the area more pleasant and safer for pedestrians, cyclists, road users and the local community.",
     "'I hope residents will carefully consider the information sent to them and visit the library to get even more information about this.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Public exhibition\"}",
     "TfL will be holding a public exhibition at the Marcus Garvey Library from 2 November to 4 December.",
     "TfL staff will be available to discuss the scheme and answer questions on Thursday 5 November and Friday 6 November, 10:00 until 19:00 and Saturday 7 November, 10:00 until 17:00.",
     "If the proposals are approved, they would be jointly funded by TfL, Haringey Council and the London Development Agency. TfL would begin construction work on the scheme in autumn 2012.",
     "The consultation will run until 4 December 2009. For more information on the proposals, visit \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tottenhamhalescheme\"\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk/tottenhamhalescheme\u003c/a\u003e ",
