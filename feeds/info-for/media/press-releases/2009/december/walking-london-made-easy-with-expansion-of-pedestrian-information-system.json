     "Some of the Capital's most visited areas, including Richmond and Twickenham, will become easier to explore on foot from this month due to the expansion of Transport for London's (TfL's) pedestrian information system  'Legible London'.",
     "The scheme was launched in November 2007 and is already successfully guiding pedestrians around the Bond Street area of London.",
     "Now, three additional areas of the Capital are getting their own set of Legible London signs, maps and fingerposts designed to make it quicker and easier to navigate around each location on foot.",

This pilot is being delivered in partnership with the London Boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark, Cross River Partnership, South Bank Employers' Group, Better Bankside and Waterloo Quarter BID\",\"A further West End scheme, in partnership with Camden and Westminster Councils, covering the area between Bloomsbury, Covent Garden and Holborn, which has a large number of Tube stations between which travelling by foot is the quickest option\",\"Legible London is part of work to reduce the overall amount of street clutter. Its installation will allow the removal of obsolete signage that currently stands in many areas, making life easier for pedestrians\"]}",

     "'I'm delighted that three additional areas of the Capital are now benefitting from the system, and am confident that Legible London will help encourage thousands more to stride out on foot, helping to boost health and cut congestion and pollution.'",
     "Ben Plowden, Director of Integrated Programme Delivery, TfL, said: 'London's size can make it challenging to navigate the city on foot, leading to people using the Tube or buses for shorter journeys when it is often quicker to walk.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Enjoyable and convenient\"}",
     "'The Legible London scheme has already helped hundreds of thousands of pedestrians in central London quickly get their bearings and walk between landmarks, attractions and other amenities without getting lost.",
     "'By expanding the system to other areas of the Capital, including an outer London borough for the first time, we hope to increase the number of pedestrian journeys in these areas and help people discover how enjoyable and convenient walking can be.'",
     "The three Legible London pilots are being delivered in partnership with London boroughs, business improvement districts and private land owners.",
     "From 2010/11, these groups will be able to develop and manage their own Legible London schemes, with advice and guidance from TfL, subject to obtaining the necessary third party funding.",
