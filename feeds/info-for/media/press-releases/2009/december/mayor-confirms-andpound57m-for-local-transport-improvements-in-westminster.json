     "The Mayor has simplified the system - reducing the number of funding streams from 23 to five, and introducing fairer funding formulas where needed.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy, said: 'Westminster has identified a range of small and large scale projects that will make a real difference to local people by improving town centres and public spaces, reducing the number of collisions on our roads, improving the environment and promoting greener forms of travel.",
