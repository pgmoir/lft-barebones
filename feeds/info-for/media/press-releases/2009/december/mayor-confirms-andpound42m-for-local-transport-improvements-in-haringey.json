     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'Even in these tough economic times I am committed to providing this funding to all of London's boroughs.",
     "'The investment means that across the Capital, town centres and public spaces are being overhauled, cycling and walking facilities are being improved, and roads are being made safer.",
     "'We have cut red tape to make it easier for borough councils to choose the local transport projects that benefit their residents the most, simplifying the funding system and working together to give local people the improvements they want.",

     "'This time we're also giving an extra focus to cycling - helping to provide the training, cycle parking, and maintenance knowhow to support the introduction of the first two Cycle Superhighways next year.'",
     "Funding for local schemes is allocated each year by Transport for London (TfL).",
     "The Mayor has simplified the system - reducing the number of funding streams from 23 to five, and introducing fairer funding formulas where needed.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy, said: 'Haringey has identified a range of small and large scale projects that will make a real difference to local people by improving town centres and public spaces, reducing the number of collisions on our roads, improving the environment and promoting greener forms of travel.",
     "'Haringey also has the flexibility to move certain funding between projects if, during the course of the year, they find more or less funding is needed for individual schemes.'",
