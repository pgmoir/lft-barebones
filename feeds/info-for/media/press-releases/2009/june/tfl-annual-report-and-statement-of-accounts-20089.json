     "As in previous years, it also sets out the number of senior employees earning over £50k.",
     "TfL also confirmed today the decision by the Mayor and Transport Commissioner to freeze TfL senior salaries.",
     "Despite a big increase in weekend closures as the network is rebuilt and improved, a record 1.1bn passengers were carried on the Tube last year, as the percentage of planned services run increased and delays were reduced.",
     "Staff across TfL and LU also worked to rescue the collapsed Metronet, preserving the line upgrades so vital to London's future development and growth and saving around £2.5bn of fare and taxpayers' money.",
     "London Buses saw passenger numbers rise again to over 2.2bn. On the Docklands Light Railway, over 66m passengers were carried as 96 per cent of services operated.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"London Overground\"}",

     "TfL plans further massive investment and improvements this year (2009/10) with an increased Budget of £9.2bn.",
     "However, in responding to the tough economic climate and pressures on TfL's finances, the Mayor and Transport Commissioner have decided to freeze the base salaries of TfL's directors and senior management this year. A pay freeze is not being asked of the vast majority of TfL employees.",
     "As well as a freeze on all senior management salaries, the total amount of performance-related bonuses will also be lower this year.",
     "A review of performance-related bonuses to be paid in future years is also being undertaken and a new performance structure will be introduced, focusing on delivery against the Mayor's longer-term transport objectives and demonstrating clear value for money.",

     "TfL's Accounts for 2008/9 show that the number of employees who earned more than £50k last year increased from 1,954 to 4,204, very largely as a result of two major organisations - Metronet and Crossrail - becoming part of TfL. An analysis of this increase shows that:",

     "The increase in the number of staff earning more than £50k at TfL, excluding the former Metronet and Crossrail organisations, is due to last year's pay increase of 4.1 per cent, the last year of a three-year deal agreed in 2006 with the previous Mayor.",
     "It is also the result of one-off awards made to a number of staff for their work on rescuing Metronet, which has saved London's fare and taxpayers £2.5bn.",

     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: 'In these tough economic times, it is right to freeze the salaries of TfL's senior management and reduce bonus levels.",
     "'It is also right that TfL has the calibre of people needed to deliver a huge work programme, including upgrading the Tube and building Crossrail, while at the same time improving day-to-day services for customers.",
     "'As the collapse of Metronet demonstrated so vividly, any failure to do so would ultimately cost London's fare and taxpayers dearly.",
     "'TfL must also demonstrate that it is delivering value for fare and taxpayers' money. Supported by a much more professional TfL Board, I will be relentless in ensuring that this is the case in the years ahead.'",
     "Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy said: 'TfL has delivered improved services for our customers over the last year, but there is so much more to be done.",
     "'With a budget this year alone of £9.2bn, we have an enormous amount of work to do which must be delivered on time and at or below budget.",
     "'We also continue to seek efficiencies across the organisation.  It is vital we have an experienced and capable management team to deliver that.'",
