     "Artist David Blandy has worked with staff and disadvantaged young people from charity Fairbridge to create alternative superhero personas for the latest commission by Art on the Underground called Underground Heroes.",
     "Drawing on their own interests and aspirations, the young people's characters were brought to life through colourful make-up and imaginative, transformative costumes and then photographed for a series of portraits.",
     "These artworks will be displayed at the entrance to Charing Cross Underground station and will help brighten customers' journeys.",
     "The young people also devised their own heroic adventures with David Blandy and female manga illustrator Inko for a trail of comic strips along the foot tunnel at Embankment station.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Young people\"}",
     "The artworks aimed to take the young people on a personal journey which echo the physical ones taken by three-and-a-half to four million customers on the London Underground each day.",
     "David Blandy said: 'I find that the things I'm interested in, such as hip hop music, comics and computer games, are often shared with the young people I work with.",
     "'Thinking about where your identity is formed, your teenage years are crucial as this is when you're first really confronted by popular culture.",
     "'By working with young people going through that stage in their own lives it turns an abstract idea into a realised entity, such as becoming a comic book hero.",

     "'One of this project's aims was to give that potential to the young people to explore the question: who am I and who can I be?",
     "'It has been great fun to go with them on that journey, continuing Art on the Underground's commitment to working with young people from local communities as well as commissioning ambitious new work from artists.'",

     "'I wasn't attending school when I first came to Fairbridge about a year ago but now I've done my City and Guilds English and Maths certificates and I'm looking into other courses at college.",
     "'I can't wait to see all of us up on the Underground in our characters.'",
     "Andrew Purvis, Fairbridge Chief Executive, said: 'At Fairbridge we believe that all young people should have opportunities to discover their talents and develop aspirations for the future.",
     "'It will be a very special moment when the young people unveil their work on the Underground - and indeed a unique opportunity for thousands of commuters to view and celebrate the achievements of the disadvantaged young people Fairbridge is supporting to make positive changes in their lives.'",
