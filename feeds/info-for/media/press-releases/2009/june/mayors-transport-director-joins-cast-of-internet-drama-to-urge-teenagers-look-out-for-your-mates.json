     "The Mayor's Director of Transport Policy and three members of the cast of hit teenage drama 'Sofia's Diary' took part in a discussion with a group of teenagers from Grey Coat School about young people's attitude to road safety.",
     "Young teenagers are seen as a vulnerable road user group.",
     "This is associated with their growing independence and the need for them to travel to school on their own before they have developed the skills to recognise the risks there are on the roads.",
     "TfL's road safety unit organised the session as part of its ongoing work to reduce the number of young people killed or seriously injured (KSI) on the Capital's roads.",

     "Teen road casualty figures for 2008 show an encouraging reduction in the number of teenagers KSIs on the Capital's roads.",
     "The number of teenage (13-to-19-year-olds) KSIs fell a further seven per cent in 2008 compared to 2007 and are now 46 per cent down on the numbers in 2000.",

     "Chris Lines, Head of the TfL London Road Safety Unit, said 'London has seen a further reduction in the number of teenage casualties, but the message still needs to be loud and clear - every day a teenager is killed or seriously injured on London Roads.",
     "'There are many contributing factors to any collision and Transport for London takes tackling them very seriously.",
     "'We are working closely with the London boroughs and spending Â£45m this year on further safety measures.'",
