     "Never approach minicab drivers. If any minicab driver comes up to you, they're acting illegally so don't get in",
     "A new hard-hitting campaign warning Londoners about the dangers of using unbooked minicabs is being launched Friday 27 November by the Mayor, Transport for London, the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) and the City of London Police (CoLP).",
     "Timed to coincide with the start of the Christmas party season it features a powerful TV and cinema advert to get across the message that getting into any minicab without booking is illegal, potentially dangerous and can pose the serious risk of sexual assault.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Safer travel at night\"}",
     "The campaign is part of the Mayor's Safer Travel at Night initiative.",
     "Since it was launched six years ago the number of women willing to take illegal cabs has dropped by almost 80 per cent, while the number of cab related sexual offences has almost halved.",
     "However a small but significant number of younger women continue to use illegal cabs despite the dangers they pose.",
     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'London is one of the safest big cities in the world but it is hugely important that everyone takes this message on board - minicabs that haven't been booked are illegal and a threat to your personal safety.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Text Cabwise\"}",
     "'Don't take the risk and don't let your friends do it either. Save the Cabwise text number, 60835, in your phone and use it.'",
     "Jenny Fawson, Director of Personal Safety for Suzy Lamplugh Trust said: 'Suzy Lamplugh Trust has long campaigned to warn people of the dangers of using illegal cabs.",
     "'These are illegal, uninsured and potentially very dangerous.",
     "'Many people who have used unbooked minicabs have been victims of crimes such as theft, assault and rape.",
     "'Suzy Lamplugh Trust supports the Mayor and TfL in urging late night travellers to make personal safety their top priority this Christmas party season.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Risk of attack\"}",
     "Steve Burton, TfL's Director of Community Safety, Enforcement and Policing, said:  'Revellers should be aware that only black cabs can be stopped and picked up off the street without being booked.",
     "'Illegal cabs put people, particularly women, at risk of sexual attack and by booking your minicab you'll ensure a record of your trip is kept and in the event of any problems the driver will be traced.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e'Remember - never approach minicab drivers and if any minicab driver comes up to you, they're acting illegally so don't get in.'",
     "Chief Superintendent Joe Royle, MPS Safer Transport Command said:  'We are determined that people get home safely after a night out in the Capital, which is why the Safer Transport Command is clamping down on illegal cabs.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Reduce crime\"}",
     "'Minicab drivers that approach Londoners anywhere in the Capital touting for business pose a real danger to late night travellers.",
     "'Our Cab Enforcement Unit's dedicated anti-touting initiatives will help reduce crime in the run up to Christmas.'",
     "It is illegal for any minicab, even if they hold a TfL licence, to tout for business on the street or to carry out a journey that has not been booked through a licensed operator.",
     "Booking guarantees that your trip will be with a licensed driver in a licensed vehicle. It also means that a record of your journey, your driver and vehicle will be kept so in the event of any problems the driver can be traced. Only licensed taxis (black cabs) can be hailed in the street or picked up at a rank without a booking.",
     "The Safer Travel at Night initiative is a partnership between Transport for London (TfL), the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) and the City of London Police (CoLP).",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Boost awareness\"}",
     "It aims to make people travelling at night, in particular women, aware of the dangers of picking up unbooked minicabs off the street, as well as informing them of the best ways to get home safely.",
     "Since it launched in 2002 cab-related sexual offences have fallen from an average of 15 to eight offences each month and the number of women using illegal cabs has also fallen from 19 per cent in 2003 to four per cent in 2009.",
