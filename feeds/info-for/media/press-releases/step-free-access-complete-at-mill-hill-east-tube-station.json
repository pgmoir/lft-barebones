     "The new lift and link bridge were built off-site and craned into the station in August last year in a complex overnight operation.",
     "This reduced the amount of time that engineers needed to work on site, ensuring that disruption to customers was kept to a minimum. Since then contractors have worked hard to divert critical services, upgrade the station systems and install the lift.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eHeidi Alexander, Deputy Mayor for Transport, said\u003c/strong\u003e : 'The introduction of step-free access at Mill Hill East will improve the daily lives of passengers who use this busy station, especially disabled people, older people and those with young children.",

     "Mill Hill East is the 79th station to become step-free on the London Underground network and the 11th since 2016.",
     "Another 11 Tube stations will become step free this year - meaning a third of the Tube network will be fully accessible for customers with mobility needs, heavy luggage or with children in buggies. In addition, since 2016, 10 TfL Rail stations and three London Overground stations have been made step-free.",
     "The next phase of the London Underground Accessibility Programme will see another eight Tube stations made step-free by spring 2024. This will make 38% of the Tube network fully accessible.",
     "The continued modernisation of the Tube is a key part of the Mayor's Transport Strategy to make London a greener, more accessible place.",
     "The investment in improving public transport will help reduce reliance on the car and contribute to the Mayor's target of 80% of journeys made by public transport, cycling or walking by 2041.",
