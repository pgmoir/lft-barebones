     "'Once the work is complete, the escalators will be more reliable and there will be less disruption to journeys through the station as a result.",
     "This modernisation work complements the proposed major upgrade of Camden Town station which would see the station treble in size, gain three new escalators and become step-free.",

     "With over 30 million customers using the station each year, Camden Town is already one of the busiest interchanges on the Underground.",

     "A typical 15-metre rise escalator has approximately 15,000 moving parts. LU's escalators tend to be in operation in both directions for up to 20 hours a day and must be refurbished every 20 years and replaced every 40 years.",
