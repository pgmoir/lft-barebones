     "This autumn, Transport for London (TfL) is encouraging people to explore the Capital with 40 free guided walks. Autumn Ambles, on Saturday 23 and Sunday 24 September, covers a variety of fun themes, with walks varying in length from one to 10 miles and stretching across London from Wimbledon to Cockfosters.",
     "New walks for 2017 include a specially designed dementia-friendly stroll around the flora and fauna of Southwark Park and a rock 'n' roll themed tour of the famous sights of Camden. The walks are very popular, so people are advised to reserve their free place via walklondon.org.uk .",
     "The walks are taking place one month after Public Health England released statistics showing how millions of people across the UK still don't walk the recommended amount each month. GLA analysis also shows that if every Londoner walked or cycled for 20 minutes a day, it would save the NHS Â£1.7bn in treatment costs over the next 25 years.",
     "These walks offer a great opportunity with something to suit all ages and abilities, with levels ranging from challenging treks to short strolls. Each walk is led by an experienced Walk London guide.",
     "New and exciting walks on offer this autumn include:",
     "Saturday 23 September:",

     "Will Norman, Walking and Cycling Commissioner, said: `This year's guided walks include some fascinating new looks at our great capital. I hope they inspire even more Londoners to get out and about, as walking is not only the best way to explore everything London has to offer, it's also great for your health and well-being.'",
     "Ben Plowden, Director of Surface Strategy and Planning at TfL, said: `Making walking an activity for all Londoners regardless of their age or ability is something we encourage, so we're delighted to offer a new dementia-friendly walk, as well as those great for the whole family.'",
     "Esther Watts, Senior Dementia Friendly Communities Officer at Alzheimer's Society, said: `I'm delighted that TfL and Walk Unlimited  have chosen to work with Alzheimer's Society and Cool Tan Arts to provide a dementia-friendly walk in this year's Autumn Ambles.  Exercise is important for everyone's health and wellbeing, including people living with dementia who may not get as many opportunities to explore London. The sensory walk at Southwark Park is a great way for families to enjoy exercise together.'",
     "The Mayor's draft Transport Strategy includes the aim of increasing the proportion of people walking, cycling and taking public transport to 80 per cent of journeys by 2041, compared to 64 per cent now, meaning an average of three million fewer car journeys in London each day. To make this commitment a reality, a wide range of improvements to London's streets, junctions and public spaces are underway, including the installation of more than 1,700 Legible London signs across the Capital, making it easier and more enjoyable to walk around London.",
