     "London Underground (LU) is reminding customers who use Chalk Farm Tube station that essential work to replace the station's two lifts starts this weekend.",
     "The Tube station will be closed on Saturday 22 and Sunday 23 July 2017 to allow preparatory works to be completed.",
     "From Monday 24 July 2017 until mid-August 2018 the station will operate with a reduced lift service, as the lifts are refurbished one at a time. During this time customers will be able to continue using the station as normal. They will be advised to use the remaining lift or, if able, the staircase (53 steps in addition to 20 existing steps from the lower lift landing to the platforms) to access the Northern line.",
     "Currently the station, which sees 5.6m journeys each year, is served by two 50-person lifts, which are nearly 40-years-old and need replacing. The works will greatly improve their reliability, reducing failures and ensuring that customers face fewer delays. The new lifts will also include CCTV and hearing induction loops.",
     "Mark Wild, London Underground's Managing Director, said:",
     "'I'm sorry for the disruption that the lift work will cause our customers, but the new lifts will be more reliable with fewer delays when the work is complete. Replacing the lifts one at a time means we can keep the station open while the work is being carried out. We will work hard to complete this vital upgrade as quickly as possible, keeping customers and local businesses up to date as the work progresses.'",
     "During the closure weekend, customers are advised to use local bus routes 168 or N5 from stop CC on Haverstock Hill to Belsize Park station and allow extra time for their journey.",
