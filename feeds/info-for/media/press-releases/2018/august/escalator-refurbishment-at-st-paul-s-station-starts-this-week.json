     "London Underground's escalators tend to be in operation in both directions for up to 20 hours a day and must be refurbished every 20 years and replaced every 40 years.",
     "The escalators at St Paul's Tube station, which were installed in 1997, will be refurbished one at a time to boost their safety and reliability. This will ensure the station can manage increasing customer demand as London's population continues to grow. The refurbishment work is scheduled to finish in April 2019.",

On the weekends of 11 and 12 June and 18 and 19 June, platform work at Bank station means that Central line trains will not be stopping at the station overnight, so during Night Tube hours customers who wish to travel from St. Paul's should use Chancery Lane. Bus routes N8 and 25 connect these stations.",
     "Peter McNaught, Director of Asset Operations at London Underground, said: \"I'm sorry for the disruption the escalator refurbishment will cause to customers but this is vital work that will improve journeys through St Paul's Tube station for years to come. Once the work is complete, the escalators will be more reliable and there will be less disruption to journeys as a result.\"",
     "Over 17 million customers use St Paul's Underground station every year.",
     "The escalators used on the Tube are heavy-duty machines which weigh around 40 tonnes and carry millions of people each year. A typical 15-metre rise escalator has approximately 15,000 moving parts.\u003cbr /\u003eThe continued modernisation of London Underground is a key part of the Mayor's Transport Strategy to make London a greener, more accessible place. The investment in improving public transport will help reduce reliance on the car and contribute to the Mayor's target of 80% of journeys made by public transport, cycling or walking by 2041.",
