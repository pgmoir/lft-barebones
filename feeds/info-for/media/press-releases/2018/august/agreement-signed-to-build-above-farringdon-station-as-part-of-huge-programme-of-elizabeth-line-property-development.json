     "'As with all of our buildings, we have put design quality and the needs of occupiers first.",
     "'The design changes proposed for the scheme result in a unique product offering for Clerkenwell with large floor plates, uncompromised office space combining seamlessly with a real focus on the wellbeing of its occupants through carefully designed large scale outdoor spaces, a re-thinking of the traditional office reception and provision of spaces for health and fitness.'",
     "The Elizabeth line sites are a key part of TfL's plans to establish a significant long-term revenue stream to reinvest in transport.",
     "Last year, TfL brought forward sites which will deliver more than 3,800 homes, half of which will be affordable.",
     "This year, TfL is planning to bring forward land for at least another 3,000 new homes, again half of which will be affordable.",
     "The introduction of the Elizabeth line supports the Mayor's Transport Strategy, which aims to create a fairer, greener, healthier and more prosperous city by improving public transport and reducing reliance on car journeys.",
