     "Transport for London (TfL) is reminding customers that sections of the Tube network will be closed this weekend. The Circle line and parts of the District, Hammersmith \u0026 City and Metropolitan lines will be closed on Saturday 3 and Sunday 4 November to facilitate work on the brand-new signalling system that will boost capacity by 33 per cent when the project is complete in 2023.",
     "The closure will allow engineering teams to run test trains on the newly-installed signalling system around the complex Aldgate junction, where the four lines all intersect. Aldgate is one of the key junctions involved in the upgrade, along with locations like Baker Street and Earl's Court.",
     "When the new system is completed, it will allow trains to operate closer together, provide greater reliability and improve customer information. The frequency of trains running through the central London sections will start to increase from 2021 with the full improvement of 32 trains per hour in place by 2023, after which a Night Tube service will be possible.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eStuart Harvey, TfL's Director of Major Projects, said:\u003c/strong\u003e \"The complex modernisation of these four Tube lines will make a huge impact on the whole Tube network. It will significantly boost capacity and reliability, making journeys better for hundreds of thousands of customers every day. I thank customers in advance for their patience during this essential closure, and advise that they should plan journeys in advance before travelling. The latest travel advice will be on our website and social media channels during the weekend.\"",
     "The work will mean that:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"The Circle line will be closed all weekend\",\"The District line will be closed between South Kensington and East Ham\",\"The Hammersmith \\u0026 City line will be closed between Baker Street and Barking\",\"The Metropolitan line will be closed between Baker Street and Aldgate\\u003cbr /\\u003e\"]}",
     "There will also be a closure north of Queen's Park on the Bakerloo line for separate engineering works by Network Rail, but the rest of the Tube network will be running normally. However, other lines will be busier than usual, particularly at interchange stations like Earl's Court, South Kensington, Notting Hill Gate, Oxford Circus, Green Park, Tottenham Court Road, Holborn and Bank.",
     "Rail replacement buses will run from Tower Hill to Barking via Canning Town in east London, and extra buses will operate in west London. As well as the Tube closures, work will be completed on London Overground between Willesden Junction and Shepherd's Bush over the weekend. Closures will be in place between Euston and Watford Junction and between Willesden Junction and Clapham Junction on Sunday 4 November only. TfL Rail will have no service between Liverpool Street and Shenfield all weekend due to Network Rail work.",
     "Any customers wishing to attend the events at the Tower of London to mark 100 years since the end of the First World War should be aware that Tower Hill station will be closed on Sunday. Alternative stations are available a short walk from the Tower, and full information can be found on our website at \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tower-remembers\"\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk/tower-remembers\u003c/a\u003e .",
     "The four lines are among some of the oldest sections of the Underground network, with parts dating back to 1863. These lines share a lot of track, which is why they are being modernised under a single project. Together they make up 40 per cent of the Tube network, and carry around a million passengers each day."
