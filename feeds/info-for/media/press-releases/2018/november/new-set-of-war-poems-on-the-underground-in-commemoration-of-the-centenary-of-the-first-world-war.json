     "A new set of poems that pay homage to the experiences of those affected by war have now been installed on the London Underground. The poems are accompanied by the relaunching of the Transport for London \"War Poems on the Underground\" leaflet that is available at many Zone 1 stations including Covent Garden, Tower Hill and Westminster.",
     "The collection features the poems \"Everyone Sang\" by Siegfried Sassoon, \"Thaw\" by Edward Thomas, who died at the Battle of Arras in April 1917, \"Heroes\" by Kathleen Raine, \"Armistice Day\" by Charles Causley, \"The place where we are right\" by Yehuda Amichai and \"Inscription for a War\" by A.D. Hope.",
     "The poems are appearing across the Tube network as Transport for London recognises the centenary since the armistice of the First World War and the sacrifices made by servicemen and women.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eNigel Holness, Managing Director of London Underground, said:\u003c/strong\u003e \"These poems serve as an important reminder of World War One, lest we forget, and the different emotions the war would have provoked at the time. As customers travel across our network and see them, they can reflect on London from a different time and how those events have shaped our world today.\"",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eJudith Chernaik, writer, editor and founder of Poems of the Underground, said: \u003c/strong\u003e \"Terrible as was the First World War, and the many wars which have followed, we wanted to stress in these poems the hope of renewal and the possibility of returning life, as each new generation struggles to learn from the past.\"",
     "Poems on the Underground, founded in 1986, aims to bring poetry to a mass audience. It helps to make journeys more stimulating by showcasing a diverse range of poetry, including classical, contemporary and international poets in Tube train carriages across London. The poems are selected by writer Judith Chernaik and poets Imtiaz Dharker and George Szirtes.",
     "The programme has inspired similar displays on public transport in cities worldwide, from New York and Paris to Moscow and Shanghai. Poems on the Underground is supported by Transport for London, Arts Council England and the British Council."
