     "The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and TfL have today announced that Elizabeth line pay as you go fares within Zones 1-6 will be the same as the fares on existing TfL services, ensuring affordable travel for millions of Londoners when the railway opens through central London in December this year.",
     "All customer service and travel information on the line will be fully integrated with TfL's other services, with daily fare capping for Oyster and contactless applying.",
     "Today's announcement means that journeys on the brand-new railway from east London stations such as Whitechapel or Canary Wharf through central London to stations in the west such as Paddington, Southall or Ealing Broadway will cost the same as an equivalent Tube journey.",
     "As a result, passengers on the Elizabeth line will reap the benefits of the Mayor's TfL fares freeze, currently benefitting 4 million transport journeys across London every day.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Brand-new railway\"}",
     "Customers will also see savings well in advance of the Elizabeth line opening in December. From Sunday 20 May, the current Heathrow Connect service between Heathrow Terminals 2/3, Heathrow Terminal 4 and Paddington will be transferred to TfL.",
     "While TfL zones do not apply to these Heathrow fares, for the first time, customers will be able to use pay as you go with Oyster and contactless across the route all the way from Paddington to Heathrow. Fares will also be cheaper or in line with the current standard fares charged for Heathrow Connect.",
     "Standard zonal fares will continue to apply for journeys between Paddington and Hayes \u0026 Harlington, with special single fares applying for journeys to and from Heathrow Airport.",
     "Example fares include:",

From May, this will fall to £7.30 (peak) and £6.00 (off-peak)\"]}",
     "As part of the integrated service, daily fare capping for Oyster and contactless and weekly fare capping for contactless will apply, with travelcards that cover Zone 6 able to be used on services to Heathrow.",
     "For daily and weekly capping, Heathrow will be designated as 'Zone 6', meaning that 'pay as you go' customers travelling to and from the Airport from within Zones 1-6 will never pay more than the daily cap of £12.50.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Significantly reduce the cost\"}",
     "All concessions which offer free or discounted travel, including the Zip Card, 60+ photocards and Veterans Concessionary Travel, will be valid on the Elizabeth line.",
     "This will significantly reduce the cost for families travelling to Heathrow via Paddington, and mean that, from May 2018, a family of four (two adults and two children under 11) will save more than £10 travelling from Paddington to Heathrow.",
     "Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: 'The opening of the Elizabeth Line this year will transform travel across London, with new state-of-the-art trains transporting millions of people more quickly around the capital.",
     "'I'm delighted to announce today that the cost of travelling on the Elizabeth Line in Zones 1-6 will be the same price as a similar journey on the tube - fulfilling a key manifesto pledge to deliver truly world-class transport infrastructure which is also accessible and affordable for all Londoners.",
     "'For Londoners going to Heathrow, many of the benefits will be felt in a matter of months, with Oyster, Contactless, and cheaper fares coming in when TfL takes over the service from Heathrow Connect in May.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Transform travel\"}",
     "Mike Brown MVO, London's Transport Commissioner, said: 'From May customers travelling to Heathrow Airport from Paddington will be able to enjoy the convenience of using Oyster or contactless as they do across the rest of the TfL network, guaranteeing the cheapest fare.",
     "'Customers will also see staff at our stations at all times when trains are running to offer them assistance, and will benefit from our 'turn-up-and-go' service for anyone needing assistance. All travel information will also be fully integrated with our other transport services.",
     "'When Elizabeth line services through central London open in December, they will transform travel across London.",
     "'The railway will provide many new direct journey options between Canary Wharf, central London and Heathrow Airport, and will cut journey times dramatically and ensure London remains a world-leading city.'",
     "Steve Chambers, Public Transport Campaigner, Campaign for Better Transport said: 'This is good news for Londoners, integrating the Elizabeth line with the familiar Oyster card and contactless bank card ticketing system.",
     "'Lower fares, particularly at off-peak times, encourage people to travel where there is capacity and can benefit part time workers.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Affordable\"}",
     "Jasmine Whitbread, Chief Executive of Business Group, London First, said: 'The brand new Elizabeth Line will dramatically improve journeys across our capital and to London's global hub at Heathrow, and ensuring fares are affordable is great news for Londoners and visitors alike.",
     "'London's businesses have worked hard to support, and help pay for, the Elizabeth line and we're counting the days until it opens its doors.'",
     "Jace Tyrrell, CEO of New West End Company, said 'Integrating the Elizabeth line in to London's existing transport network is crucial to its success and will ensure that benefits from this once-in-a-generation opportunity are properly realised.",
     "'New West End Company welcomes TfL's decision to launch the service with lower fares and a single ticketing system, enabling the West End to remain competitive and attractive with both visitors and employees.'",
     "Kay Buxton, Executive Director of The Paddington Partnership, said: 'Paddington is synonymous with transport innovation and connectivity boasting an illustrious heritage from the origins of Great Western Railway and the home of Heathrow Express to the forthcoming introduction of the Elizabeth line.",
     "'The Mayor of London's decision to extend the TfL fare freeze to the Elizabeth line demonstrates London's position as a global leader in infrastructure and development.",
     "'The Paddington Partnership has and continues to prepare for the influx of visitors, workers and interest to the local area by becoming the capital's fastest growing and most dynamic location.",
     "'In the past 10 years, over 3.3 million sq ft of contemporary and conscientious retail, leisure, office and residential developments have launched or are in the pipeline to support the area's connectivity today and in the future.'",
     "John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow's Chief Executive said: 'The opening of the Elizabeth line will help make travel to the airport more accessible and sustainable for millions of passengers and colleagues.",
     "'This service, along with new rail connections to the south and west and HS2 through Old Oak Common, will put Heathrow at the heart of an integrated transport network, reduce traffic around the airport, and improve local air quality.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Redefine transport\"}",
     "Opening through central London in December 2018, the Elizabeth line will redefine transport in London with quicker, easier and more accessible journeys.",
     "The new railway, jointly sponsored by the Department for Transport and TfL, will connect stations such as Paddington to Canary Wharf in only 17 minutes, transforming how Londoners and visitors move across the Capital.",
     "From May, TfL Rail services will operate two trains an hour between Paddington and Heathrow using the existing Heathrow Connect trains, an identical frequency to now.",
     "A further two trains an hour will run between Paddington and Hayes \u0026 Harlington using the new Elizabeth line trains, replacing part of the Great Western inner suburban route.  Testing is underway to allow TfL to introduce the new Elizabeth line trains to the airport.",
