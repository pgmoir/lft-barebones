     "TfL today confirmed that lifts have been installed at Bromley-by-Bow station for the first time, making it the 73rd step-free station on London's Underground network.",
     "The station, which serves nearly four million customers every year, will feature step-free access to both the east and westbound platforms of the District and Hammersmith \u0026 City lines, making travel easier for disabled customers, buggy users, older people and customers with mobility impairments.",
     "The completion of the work follows the Mayor of London's recent announcement that another 13 stations are set to go step-free by spring 2022. In total, £200m is being invested in transforming accessibility as part of the largest boost to step-free access in the Tube's 155-year history.",
     "This will help make 40% of the Tube network step-free by 2022 - a significant increase on the current level of 27%.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Step-free access\"}",
     "The work at Bromley-by-Bow, which was funded in partnership with Tower Hamlets and the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), has seen two lifts installed at the station.",
     "One connects the eastbound platform to the ticket hall, while another connects an existing overbridge to the westbound platform.",
     "The lifts both provide step-free access from the street to the new S stock trains, which are part of the huge modernisation of the 40% of the Tube network that includes the District and Hammersmith \u0026 City lines.",
     "Deputy Mayor for Transport Val Shawcross said: 'We're determined to ensure that London has a modern transport network that is accessible for every Londoner.",
     "'That's why Sadiq is investing records sums to deliver the largest boost to step-free access in the Tube's 155-year history.",
     "'I'm delighted that Bromley-by-Bow is the next station to go step-free and know that these new lifts will make a particular difference helping parents with young children, older people and those with disabilities get around safely and easily every day.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Hugely important\"}",
     "Caroline Sheridan, London Underground's Director of Renewals and Enhancements, said: 'The new lifts at Bromley-by-Bow will totally transform the experience of customers in the local area with mobility impairments.",
     "'Making our entire network more accessible is hugely important, both to us and to the Mayor, and we are determined to do more to enable everyone to use the Tube network.",
     "'The Mayor has pledged another £200m to boost accessibility and we will be delivering further improvements in the coming years.'",
     "John Biggs, Mayor of Tower Hamlets, said: 'I'm delighted that the works to make Bromley-by-Bow station step-free are complete.",
     "'TfL, Tower Hamlets Council and the LLDC have come together in partnership to contribute towards the installation of these vital lifts. This will make a huge difference in making transport in the Borough accessible for all.'",
     "Rob Johnson, Project Lead at Local Voices, said: 'It is excellent news to see Bromley-by-Bow going step-free this week.",
     "'Public transport in this area can be problematic for the disabled community which also hosts several disability organisations.",
     "'Step-free at Bromley-by-Bow will also give that community much easier access to connections at West Ham for to the Jubilee Line, DLR and Fenchurch Street services.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Fairer, greener, healthier\"}",
     "Alongside the completion of step-free access at Bromley-by-Bow, work is continuing at Victoria, Newbury Park and Buckhurst Hill, which are scheduled to become step-free later this year.",
     "Lifts at Harrow-on-the-Hill are scheduled to be operational in 2020. Work is progressing at Knightsbridge, Bank and Finsbury Park as well, and step-free work at other stations is planned to start later this year.",
     "This wider step-free access work on the Tube is a key part of the Mayor's draft Transport Strategy, which aims to create a fairer, greener, healthier and more prosperous city by improving public transport and reducing reliance on car journeys.",
     "The full opening of the Elizabeth line in 2019 will be another huge moment for the accessibility of London's transport network, with every station being step-free.",
     "TfL also has the most accessible bus fleet in the world, with all 9,000 buses low-floor wheelchair accessible and fitted with ramps. Work has been carried out with London's boroughs to improve bus stop accessibility with almost all bus stops now wheelchair accessible.",
     "Additionally, all 22,000 of London's taxis are fitted with wheelchair ramps and TfL has begun work to enhance access at taxi ranks.",
