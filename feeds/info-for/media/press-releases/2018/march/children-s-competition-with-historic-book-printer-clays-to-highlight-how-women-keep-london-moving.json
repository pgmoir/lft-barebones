     "TfL has today launched a children's competition with British book printing institution Clays as part of the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan's major new campaign, #BehindEveryGreatCity.",
     "The competition, which includes three different age categories, will ask children to use their imaginations to draw a picture or write a story that focuses on how women at TfL keep London moving.",
     "From the engineers who fix and control traffic lights and keep the trains running, to the designers who imagine what our streets, bridges and trains will look like in the future - there are a range of different roles to inspire the next generation.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Limited edition\"}",
     "The judging panel of acclaimed authors includes Waterstones' Children's Laureate, Lauren Child MBE, 'How to Train your Dragon' author Cressida Cowell, and 'Fantastically Great Women who Changed the World' writer, Kate Pankhurst.",
     "They will choose the winning entries, which will need to be submitted before Sunday 13 May.",
     "The winners will see their stories turned into a limited edition book, printed by Clays - with the winning drawing featured on the front cover. They will also get the opportunity to take part in a behind-the-scenes tour of TfL and visit the factory where the book is made.",
     "The Mayor of London's #BehindEveryGreatCity campaign aims to bring Londoners together to celebrate how women of all backgrounds make London the great city it is, and to take new steps to tackle gender inequality in the capital.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Keep London moving\"}",
     "Lauren Sager Weinstein, Transport for London's Chief Data Officer, said: 'This competition is a really exciting opportunity for children to put their creative hats on and think about all of the different ways women help to keep London moving.",
     "'Whether it's using computers to work out how people travel or designing new trains - writing a short story or drawing a picture is a great way for children to think about how integral women are to this city.'",
     "Vicky Ellis, Sales Director at Clays, said: 'We're excited to be partnering with Transport for London on this great writing and drawing competition for children.",
     "'Not only is this a brilliant competition to promote the awareness of the roles women can play in industries that they would have generally ruled out, but it is also promoting literacy amongst children by encouraging them to read and hone in on their creative skills.'",
     "Lauren Child MBE, said: 'As well as encouraging children to draw and write, competitions like this are a great opportunity to break down stereotypes. It is important for all children to see themselves reflected in stories and books and to have heroes they can relate to.",
     "'Celebrating brave, accomplished women who get things done is a step away from an outdated notion of girls just being the side-kick.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Inspiring TfL women\"}",
     "Cressida Cowell, said: 'I'm delighted to be a judge for Transport for London's writing and drawing award, and what a great theme, to create art celebrating the thousands of inspiring TfL women who keep London moving and whose contribution is often invisible to the general public.",
     "'The competition is also a fantastic opportunity to encourage both girls and boys to think widely about the type of career they could pursue - whether that's becoming a TfL engineer, or an author or illustrator.'",
     "Kate Pankhurst, said: 'I'm thrilled to be judging this competition and can't wait to see the inspiring stories children have to share about the part women play in keeping London moving.",
     "'It seemed a particularly exciting competition to judge as celebrating the role women play in getting people where they need to go is a great way to get children to take a closer look at the way we live today and at how they have the power to shape it with their talents and aspirations in the future.'",
     "The competition is part of a wider drive in the transport industry to encourage more women to consider a career in transport and more young people into Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).",
     "Currently, around 23% of TfL's workforce is female and only 9% of engineers are women. By creating a more diverse workforce that is representative of the city that it serves, TfL will encourage further creativity and innovation, which will lead to new ideas and ways of improving customers' journeys.",

She loves a good story, the funnier the better and gets her best ideas by doodling in her sketchbook; because even quick wonky drawings can spark ideas for amazing plots. As a child, Kate spent most of her time drawing silly characters and thinking up funny things for them to do, she feels very lucky to now do this as her job\",\"\\u003cstrong\\u003eAbout #BehindEveryGreatCity\\u003c/strong\\u003e - Sadiq Khan has launched the #BehindEveryGreatCity gender equality campaign to champion the fact that it is the achievements and contributions of women, from all walks of life, which make cities like London great. It coincides with the 100 year anniversary of the 1918 Representation of the People Act, which gave some women the vote, and was introduced thanks to the campaigning of suffragists and suffragettes. The Mayor will use the centenary to work with London's many leading sectors - from culture, sport, education and business, to politics and public life - to support the continuing success of women and to push for greater gender equality for women from all backgrounds across the city.
