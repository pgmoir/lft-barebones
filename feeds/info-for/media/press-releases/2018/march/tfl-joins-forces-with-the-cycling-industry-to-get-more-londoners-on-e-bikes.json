     "TfL is launching a new scheme with the Association of Cycle Traders and e-bike retailers to help raise awareness of the benefits of e-bikes and encourage more Londoners to take up cycling.",
     "Research by TfL shows that more than a fifth of people who don't cycle are put off because they think they aren't fit enough, feel distances are too long or say they are too old. E-bikes can help overcome these concerns as the power assisted bikes allow the rider to cycle further, and uphill, with ease.",
     "Now TfL and the Association of Cycle Traders have launched a website to allow Londoners to benefit from exclusive discounts and improved access to e-bikes to encourage more to take up cycling.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Exclusive offers\"}",
     "This website, available through \u003ca href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/cycling-in-london/electric-bikes?cid=electric-bikes\"\u003etfl.gov.uk/electric-bikes\u003c/a\u003e , brings together more than 100 stores offering free test rides across the capital - meaning that everyone can try an e-bike that suits them.",
     "TfL has also negotiated exclusive offers on e-bikes with many retailers, which are only available through the website.",
     "Will Norman, London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, said: 'I've enjoyed trying a number of e-bikes and can see what great potential they have to help Londoners get around our capital.",
     "'We're working hard to make cycling safer and more accessible, and these e-bikes can make a difference to those who feel unable to travel by bike.",
     "'By providing a boost as you pedal, the bikes help riders cycle with ease but still improve their health too. I hope through this new partnership we can encourage even more first-time cyclists to take to our capital's streets.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Cut congestion\"}",
     "Chris Mather, Chief Customer Officer at TfL, said: 'E-bikes have the potential to get many more people cycling. They are a great way of quickly getting around the city and, in turn, will help to cut congestion and tackle poor air quality.",
     "'We are delighted to be working with the cycling industry to raise awareness of the benefits of e-bikes and look forward to seeing more journeys being made by e-bike.'",
     "Jonathan Harrison, Marketing Director at the Association of Cycle Traders, said: 'As the largest cycle trade organisation in the UK it was a no-brainer to get involved in the ebikes.london project.",
     "'By collaborating with TfL, specialist cycle retailers have an excellent opportunity to help increase e-bike awareness and usage across London.",
     "'The new website allows retailers to promote what's special about their shop, what e-bike brands they stock, details about e-bike demo rides and any e-bike offers available, helping customers to find the right shop for them.",
     "'Ultimately, encouraging the use of e-bikes will increase consumer engagement and drive footfall into specialist cycle retailers, which is something the ACT always strives to do.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Record levels of investment\"}",
     "E-bike user Majonne Frost, said: 'My e-bike has put me in control of my journeys. Traffic makes driving to work unreliable, but my journeys on an e-bike are a doddle.",
     "'I can even cycle with my kids to school and carry on to work from there. I feel fitter and have saved hundreds of pounds in petrol - I'd recommend one to anyone.'",
     "The Mayor has committed record levels of investment to cycling in the capital, with £169 million per year being spent on average for five years on new infrastructure and initiatives to make cycling safer.",
     "Encouraging people to cycle is one of the key components of his Transport Strategy, which aims to make London a healthier, greener and more accessible place by investing in, and encouraging greater use of, public transport and active travel.",
     "Londoners can find out more and identify their nearest test ride opportunity at \u003ca href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/cycling-in-london/electric-bikes?cid=electric-bikes\"\u003etfl.gov.uk/electric-bikes\u003c/a\u003e ",
