     "Transport for London (TfL) is advising Docklands Light Railway (DLR) customers to check the TfL website for the latest information about planned strike action by the RMT union, which will affect services on Wednesday and Thursday this week.",
     "The strike has been called over a dispute with KeolisAmey Docklands who operate the DLR on behalf of TfL.",
     "The strike is scheduled to take place between 04:00am on Wednesday 28 March and 03:59am on Friday 30 March and it is unlikely that any DLR services will operate during these times. Services may also be affected on the morning of Friday 30 March (Good Friday). All other TfL services will be operating as usual.",
     "Extra buses will be deployed to enhance services operating on key routes along the DLR network and TfL Travel Ambassadors will be on hand at key locations to provide travel information and advice to customers. Customers are advised to allow extra time for their journeys and check before they travel at \u003ca href=\"http://tfl.gov.uk/DLR-strike\"\u003etfl.gov.uk/DLR-strike\u003c/a\u003e and use the live updated feeds @TfLTravelAlerts, @TfLTrafficNews, @TfLBusAlerts and @LondonDLR on Twitter. TfL's Travelbot can also provide customers with live status updates and travel advice via Facebook messenger. Alternative walking and cycling routes can also be found on the TfL website.",
     "The Jubilee, Central, District and Hammersmith \u0026 City lines in East London and London Overground between Highbury \u0026 Islington and Surrey Quays are expected to be busier than usual and stations close to the DLR, including Canning Town, Bank, Stratford, Canary Wharf, Canada Water and London Bridge, may also be exceptionally busy. For London City Airport, people will be advised to take the Jubilee line to Canning Town and change for buses to the airport.",
     "Posters, digital boards and announcements in stations will keep customers informed of the latest levels of service.",
     "Mark Davis, TfL's Interim General Manager of the DLR, said: `KeolisAmey Docklands predict that it is unlikely that any DLR services will run on Wednesday and Thursday due to strike action by the RMT union.  Our bus, Tube and rail services will be operating as normal, and we will be running extra buses on key routes to help keep London moving. We will have TfL Travel Ambassadors on hand at key locations to provide travel information and advice to customers. Our services, particularly in east London, are expected to be very busy and we thank everyone for their patience while the strike action takes place. Customers are advised to use our website to plan ahead.'",
     "Customers can keep up-to-date on the status of their services in a range of ways, including:",
