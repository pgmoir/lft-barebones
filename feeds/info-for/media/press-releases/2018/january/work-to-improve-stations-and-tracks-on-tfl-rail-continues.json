     "Over a series of ten weekends from late January to March, a number of essential weekend closures will allow improvement work to be carried out in advance of Elizabeth line services commencing later this year. While these are carried out, buses will replace trains along the route.",
     "The Elizabeth line will transform transport in London with quicker, easier and more accessible journeys across the Capital once fully operational in December next year. It will also support thousands of new homes and jobs in London and the South East.\u003cbr /\u003eA great deal of work has already taken place and customers going through Manor Park station will have seen the new footbridge and lift structure that has been installed as part of work to make the station accessible for everyone. Work will continue at the station during the weekend closures, including fitting the glazing and cladding to the footbridge and lifts.",
     "Transport for London (TfL) will also continue working on the lifts and footbridges at Seven Kings and on the installation of new lifts at Maryland which are due to come into passenger use later this year. This will bring step-free access to these stations, and all Elizabeth line stations will be step-free, significantly improving the accessibility of the transport network. This complements the Mayor's plan for 40 per cent of the London Underground network to be step-free by 2022.",
     "During these closures, platform canopies at Chadwell Heath, Goodmayes and Ilford will also be repaired and redecorated, which can only be done at times when trains are not running and overhead power lines are switched off.",
     "Network Rail will also continue with their station improvements, installing structures that carry overhead wires and replacing a further eight kilometres of overhead wiring between Ilford and Manor Park during the weekend closures. They will complete the remodelling of the sidings and the signalling upgrade at Gidea Park as well as completing the link between the Elizabeth line central tunnels and the Great Eastern Main Line to Shenfield.",
     "Howard Smith, Operations Director for TfL Rail, said:",
     "'I'd like to thank customers for their patience while TfL and Network Rail continue to prepare for the Elizabeth line opening from December this year. I apologise for the disruption to regular weekend travel, but it's vital that this work is done to improve the railway and upgrade the stations to make them accessible for all. The Elizabeth line will make life much easier for people along the route and will transform travel across London.'",
     "The introduction of the Elizabeth line is a central part of the Mayor's Transport Strategy, which seeks to reduce reliance on the car and tackle air pollution by encouraging greater use of public transport.",
