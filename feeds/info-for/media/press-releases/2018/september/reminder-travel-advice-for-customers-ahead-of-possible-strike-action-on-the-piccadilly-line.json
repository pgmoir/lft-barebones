     "TfL has today reminded customers that strike action on the Piccadilly line could disrupt their journeys later this week. Piccadilly line train operators who are RMT members are planning industrial action from Wednesday 26 September until Saturday 29 September. Customers should check before they travel using travel advice published on the TfL website and via social media.",
     "Talks to resolve the strike action took place yesterday and will continue today, but if it goes ahead there will be little to no service on the Piccadilly line throughout this period, including the Night Tube, on Friday 28 September.",
     "Customers are advised to complete journeys on the Piccadilly line by 13.00 on Wednesday. Services will resume at around 15.30 on Friday, but will then begin to wind down again from 22.00. Services will then resume to a normal level at around 07.30 on Saturday between Heathrow and Cockfosters and around 08.30 from Uxbridge to Acton Town.",
     "For customers travelling between Heathrow airport and central London, TfL Rail services will be available to and from London Paddington station every thirty minutes, while Heathrow Express services will also run normally.",
     "All other Tube lines are expected to run as normal. However, interchange stations along the Piccadilly line - Finsbury Park, Green Park, Hammersmith, and King's Cross St Pancras stations, in particular - will be much busier than usual.",
     "Around 70 additional buses will be in operation to help customers complete their journeys. The Mayor's Hopper fare is available all day and night - allowing Londoners to take unlimited bus and tram journeys across the capital within an hour for just Â£1.50. Tube tickets will also be accepted on buses for reasonable alternative routes.",

We have agreed steps with the RMT to solve this dispute and have been making good progress in making these changes. I urge the RMT to reconsider this action, withdraw the strikes and spare Londoners and visitors to the city needless disruption.\"\u003cbr /\u003eTfL Travel Ambassadors will be at key locations to provide travel information and advice to customers affected by this action.",
