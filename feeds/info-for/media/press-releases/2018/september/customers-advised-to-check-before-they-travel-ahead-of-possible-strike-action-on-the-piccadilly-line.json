     "TfL has today published travel advice to help Londoners get around, should strike action on the Piccadilly line take place next week. Piccadilly line train operators who are RMT members are planning industrial action from Wednesday 26 September until Saturday 29 September.",
     "Talks to resolve the strike action are planned, but if it goes ahead there will be little to no service on the Piccadilly line throughout this period, including the Night Tube, on Friday 28 September.",
     "Customers are advised to complete journeys on the Piccadilly line by 13.00 on Wednesday. Services will resume at around 15.30 on Friday, but will then begin to wind down again from 22.00. Services will then resume to a normal level at around 07.30 on Saturday between Heathrow and Cockfosters and around 08.30 from Uxbridge to Acton Town.",
     "For customers travelling between Heathrow airport and central London, TfL Rail services will be available to and from London Paddington station every thirty minutes, while Heathrow Express services will also run normally.",
     "All other Tube lines are expected to run as normal. However, interchange stations along the Piccadilly line - Finsbury Park, Green Park, Hammersmith, and King's Cross St. Pancras stations in particular - will be much busier than usual.",
     "Additional buses will be in operation to help customers complete their journeys. The Mayor's Hopper fare is also available all day and night - allowing Londoners to take unlimited bus and tram journeys across the capital within an hour for just Â£1.50.",
     "Nigel Holness TfL's Director of Network Operations for London Underground, said: 'We will provide customers with the latest information in order to help them plan their journeys during this possible strike action.",
     "'The TfL website, journey planner and social media channels will all feature up-to-date travel advice and will be updated throughout the week. We have met with the RMT leadership to identify areas where we can work together to resolve this dispute.",
     "'I urge them to continue to work constructively with us so that Londoners aren't subjected to disruption across several days next week.'",
     "TfL Travel Ambassadors will be at key locations to provide travel information and advice to customers affected by this action.",
     "Customers can keep up-to-date with the latest service information in a variety of ways, including:",
