     "Despite inviting RMT to continue discussions via the conciliation service ACAS to end the strike early, the RMT have not yet agreed to talks and will continue their planned strike action. Services will resume at around 15.30, with frequent trains between Heathrow and Cockfosters, and trains every 5 minutes between Acton Town and Uxbridge. However, the line will begin to wind down again from 22.00.",

     "For anyone travelling between Heathrow airport and central London today, TfL Rail services will be available to and from London Paddington and Ealing Broadway station every thirty minutes, while Heathrow Express services from Paddington will also run normally.",
     "All other Tube lines are expected to run as normal. However, interchange stations along the Piccadilly line - Finsbury Park, Green Park, Hammersmith, and King's Cross St Pancras stations, in particular - will continue to be much busier than usual.",
     "Around 70 additional buses will be in operation to help customers complete their journeys. The Mayor's Hopper fare is available all day and night - allowing Londoners to take unlimited bus and tram journeys across the capital within an hour for just Â£1.50. Tube tickets will also be accepted on buses for reasonable alternative routes.",

The RMT unilaterally ended discussions at ACAS on Tuesday and made no attempt to engage with us to try and resolve this dispute. Despite our request to meet the RMT at ACAS they haven't yet agreed to talks. I encourage all customers to check before they travel, and reiterate that we remain available for talks with the RMT at any time.\"",
     "TfL Travel Ambassadors will be at key locations to provide travel information and advice to customers affected by this action.",
