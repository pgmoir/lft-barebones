     "TfL today advised customers that a planned Tube strike will affect the Central, Piccadilly and Waterloo \u0026 City lines from Wednesday 7 November.",
     "This will mean no service on the Central and Waterloo \u0026 City lines all day on Wednesday 7 November. On the Piccadilly line, the action starts later on Wednesday 7, so customers should complete journeys by 13.30.",
     "There will also be no service on the Piccadilly line on the morning of Thursday 8 November, with trains resuming at around 15.00.",
     "The action is being carried out by members from both Aslef and RMT on the Central and Waterloo \u0026 City lines and by RMT members on the Piccadilly line.",
     "Further talks with both unions are planned, but should the action go ahead some stations on the Tube network will be busier than usual; all other lines will operate as normal.",
     "These include central London stations like King's Cross St Pancras, Liverpool Street, Green Park, Bond Street, Oxford Circus, Piccadilly Circus and Tottenham Court Road, as well as hubs outside central London such as Stratford, Finsbury Park, Leytonstone and Ealing Broadway.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eNigel Holness, Director of Network Operations for London Underground, said\u003c/strong\u003e : 'The strike action called by both RMT and Aslef on 7 November is totally unjustifiable.",
     "'We will keep customers up-to-date with the latest travel advice to help them re-plan their journeys, and will continue to talk to the union leadership in order to try and resolve these disputes.",
     "'I urge the unions to call off this entirely unnecessary action, which will only cause disruption to our customers, while those discussions are ongoing.'",
     "TfL will have around 150 extra buses on Wednesday 7 November to help customers move around the city, and over 80 extra buses on Thursday as the Piccadilly line recovers to a normal service following the end of the action.",
     "The Mayor's Hopper fare is also available all day and night - allowing Londoners to take unlimited bus and tram journeys across the capital within an hour for just Â£1.50.",
     "Buses, DLR, London Overground and TfL Rail services will accept Tube single and return tickets and National Rail cross-London tickets on reasonable alternative routes.",
     "Customers travelling to Heathrow Airport can use TfL Rail and Heathrow Express services from Paddington. TfL travel ambassadors will also be at key stations and locations to assist customers to re-plan journeys.",
     "Customers can keep up-to-date with the latest service information in a variety of ways, including:",
