     "TfL has today published travel advice to help Londoners get around should strike action on the Central and Waterloo \u0026 City lines take place this week.",
     "Central line train operators who are ASLEF members are currently planning industrial action on Friday 5 October.",
     "Further talks to resolve the strike action are planned, but if it goes ahead there will be no service on the Central line throughout the day, including Night Tube.",
     "The action will also affect the Waterloo \u0026 City line, which will have little to no service all day. Services will return to normal by mid-morning on Saturday.",
     "Customers travelling to or from Ealing Broadway are advised to use the District line or TfL Rail services, while those travelling from West Ruislip should use nearby Ruislip or Ickenham stations on the Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines.",
     "Customers travelling to or from stations on the Hainault loop can use TfL Rail services via Ilford, although these are expected to be extremely busy.",
     "For customers travelling to central London, all other Tube lines are expected to run as normal.",
     "However, interchange stations along the Central and Waterloo \u0026 City lines - Stratford, Liverpool Street, Tottenham Court Road, Bond Street, Mile End, Waterloo, Bank, Oxford Circus and Holborn stations in particular - will be much busier than usual.",
     "There will be around an additional 80 buses in operation to help customers complete their journeys, enhancing 10 different routes around London and two night bus routes.",
     "The Mayor's Hopper fare is also available all day and night - allowing Londoners to take unlimited bus and tram journeys across the capital within an hour for just Â£1.50.",
     "Buses, DLR, London Overground and TfL Rail services will accept Tube single and return tickets and National Rail cross-London tickets on reasonable alternative routes.",
     "Nigel Holness TfL's Director of Network Operations for London Underground, said: 'This possible strike action would mean that the Central and Waterloo \u0026 City lines are closed for the day.",
     "'If there are any changes to service levels, we will update customers through our website, journey planner and social media channels, which all feature up-to-date travel advice.",
     "'We have met with the ASLEF leadership to try to work with them to avoid strike action and I urge them to continue these positive discussions so that Londoners don't experience disruption this week.'",
     "Should the strike go ahead, TfL Travel Ambassadors will be at key locations to provide travel information and advice to customers affected by the action.",
     "Customers can keep up-to-date with the latest service information in a variety of ways, including:",
