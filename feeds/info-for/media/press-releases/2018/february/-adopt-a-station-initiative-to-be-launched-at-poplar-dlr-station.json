     "The Docklands Light Railway (DLR) will launch its 'Adopt-a-Station' initiative on Thursday 15 February, a brand new programme designed to help communities, schools and businesses make the most of their local station.",
     "The initiative, which will first be trialled at Poplar DLR station, will deliver benefits for customers and local residents by utilising space at the station to publicise events, classes and workshops taking place in the local area, while also providing a platform for art and activities of local schools, gardeners and others.",
     "These initiatives will in turn help improve the station environment, making Poplar DLR station a more attractive and pleasant place to travel through.",

     "The initiative contributes to achieving the objectives of the Mayor's draft Transport Strategy, which aims to encourage greater use of public transport and reduce reliance on car journeys - in turn creating a greener and healthier city.",
     "Mark Davis, Interim General Manager of the DLR, said: 'We are delighted to bring our 'Adopt-a-Station' programme to Poplar DLR station. Nestled in the shadow of Canary Wharf, the scheme will enable the local area to create a social and engaging hub at the heart of the community.",
