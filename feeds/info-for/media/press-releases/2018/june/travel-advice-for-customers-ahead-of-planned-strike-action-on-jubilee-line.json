     "TfL is reminding Jubilee line customers that there will be no service on the line should planned strike action by train operator union members go ahead on Thursday 14 June.",
     "If planned strike action by the RMT and ASLEF goes ahead, there will be no service on the Jubilee line all day.",
     "Early morning services on Friday are also likely to be affected. All other Tube lines will operate as normal, so customers should allow more time to complete journeys or change to a different line where possible.",
     "The dispute relates to the new timetable that boosts capacity and train frequency during peak hours which is already delivering huge benefits to Jubilee line customers across London.",
     "The rosters put in place to operate this timetable are within the agreements made between London Underground and the trade unions.",
     "Nigel Holness, TfL's Director of Network Operations for London Underground, said: 'We have adhered to our agreements and policies with the trade unions throughout this dispute. The action is completely unnecessary and will only cause disruption for customers, for which I apologise.",
     "'The new Jubilee line timetable is already benefitting thousands of Londoners every day and I call on the unions to continue working with us to deliver a good service to our customers and to call off this unjustified strike action.'",
     "TfL Travel Ambassadors will be at key locations to provide travel information and advise customers affected by this action.",
     "Around an extra 70 buses will also be in operation to help customers complete their journeys, and Metropolitan line trains that usually terminate at Baker Street will continue north to terminate at Willesden Green instead.",
     "Customers can keep up-to-date with the latest service information in a variety of ways, including:",
