     "Students from London primary and secondary schools, Special Educational Needs schools, colleges and universities near the Elizabeth line route were invited to take part, with 110 entries received.",

     "One of the key criteria for the students was to present the benefits of the new TfL Rail services between Paddington and Heathrow Airport, which will become part of the Elizabeth line from December.",
     "The winning designs showcase a variety of improvements including that stations are now staffed from first to last train and that customers can travel along the route using Oyster and contactless payment.",

     "These new trains are initially running from Paddington to Hayes \u0026 Harlington and are 160 metres long, made up of seven spacious carriages. They will later be extended to nine carriages and the full length of 200 metres to carry up to 1,500 people at a time.",
     "In December, when Elizabeth line services open through central London, the campaign will continue with creative students along the route again invited to submit their designs. The winning artwork will celebrate the opening of TfL's new railway and the benefits for the future of London.",
