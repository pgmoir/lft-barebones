     "This press release, issued by the Mayor of London, was first published on \u003ca href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/green-light-to-develop-six-new-cycle-route\"\u003elondon.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e ",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"£142m to be invested in new routes that will help grow cycling across London and also deliver benefits for pedestrians\",\"Latest year-on-year figures show that cycling grew by nearly ten per cent in 2016\"]}",
     "The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, today confirmed how the next stage of his record investment into new cycle routes will be spent, announcing the six routes where design work will begin immediately. The six new routes, across nine London boroughs, have some of the highest potential for cycling but currently lack safe infrastructure.",
     "Transport for London's (TfL's) innovative Strategic Cycling Analysis identified the top 25 connections where new cycling infrastructure is required to enable more people to cycle. Further work between TfL and the boroughs has identified these six routes as the initial routes to take forward to the design stage. The routes will extend from Tottenham in the north, to Peckham in the south, and from Barking in the east, to Willesden Junction in the west, helping to create a pan-London network of high-quality cycle routes.",
     "The new routes are an important further step in making the investment required to achieve the Mayor's aim, set out in the draft Mayor's Transport Strategy, of 80 per cent of journeys being made by foot, bike or public transport by 2041. In doing so, they will improve Londoners' health, tackle congestion and clean up London's air.",
     "TfL and the boroughs will now begin design work on:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Lea Bridge to Dalston - This 3km route would link the City and Waltham Forest by filling the gap between Lea Bridge Road and Cycle Superhighway 1 at Dalston\",\"Ilford to Barking Riverside - This 8km route would link two bustling outer London town centres and a major growth area with up to 10,800 new homes and a new London Overground connection - while enhancing access to the Elizabeth line and London Overground services\",\"Hackney to the Isle of Dogs - This 8km route would stretch from Hackney to the Isle of Dogs via Canary Wharf, Mile End and Victoria Park\",\"Rotherhithe to Peckham - This 4km route would link Peckham with key and growing destinations such as Canada Water and Surrey Quays, and connect up other cycling routes such as Quietway 1 and the proposed Cycle Superhighway 4\",\"Tottenham Hale to Camden - This 8km route would connect major town centres and will cover seven junctions identified as being among the 73 with the worst safety records\",\"Wembley to Willesden Junction - This 5km route would be north-west London's first major cycle route, connecting Wembley, Stonebridge Park and Willesden Junction. Future sections will connect to planned infrastructure in west London such as CS9 and CS10.\"]}",
     "The Mayor is also committed to providing a new river crossing between Rotherhithe and Canary Wharf for pedestrians and cyclists, which ultimately could link the proposed cycle routes between Hackney and Peckham to create a continuous 12km cycle route. An initial review of the recent consultation on the proposed Rotherhithe and Canary Wharf Crossing showed strong support for the project. TfL is still analysing all the responses and will be announcing the full results of the consultation in the coming months.",
     "Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London, said:",
     "'I've committed to invest record amounts in making cycling easier and safer for Londoners, and I'm delighted that work is now beginning on designing the next generation of high-quality cycle routes across the capital.",
     "'Working closely with the boroughs, we're providing new routes in both inner and outer London, including in areas that haven't previously seen serious investment in cycling infrastructure.",
     "'Encouraging more Londoners to cycle as part of their everyday routine is vital - providing huge benefits to people's health, cutting congestion and air pollution for every Londoner, and improving quality of life in local neighbourhoods.'",
     "Will Norman, London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, said:",
     "'High-quality cycling infrastructure cannot simply be an option available to a minority of Londoners, and our new Strategic Cycling Analysis shows that there is huge potential for getting more people to cycle all across the city.",
     "'Backed up by the Mayor's record investment, we're working in close collaboration with London boroughs to design six new cycle routes that would connect key town centres, join up existing cycle infrastructure, and start to create a genuinely pan-London network of cycle routes accessible to millions more Londoners.'",
     "Lilli Matson, TfL's Director of Transport Strategy, said:",
     "'These six new routes are set to transform cycling across nearly a third of London's boroughs, while also benefitting pedestrians and public transport users. The fact that these corridors have been carefully selected based on where they will benefit cyclists most and will be designed in such a way as to balance the needs of walking, cycling and public transport means they will deliver the best possible results for all Londoners and ensure the investment is well spent.'",
     "Fran Graham, Campaigns Coordinator, London Cycling Campaign, said:",
     "'The Mayor has laudably promised to triple the amount of protected space for cycling during this mayoralty and commence work on a safe, city-wide cycling network that every Londoner can easily access. By enabling cycling to become the natural choice for everyday journeys, this network will play a pivotal role in achieving the Mayor's goal of reducing the over-dependence on motor vehicles that is congesting our city, damaging public health and contributing to climate change.",
     "'We welcome the announcement of these important new cycle routes as part of that network. Safe, high-quality conditions for cycling are vital in opening up the enjoyment, convenience and affordability of cycling to far more people. We look forward to working with TfL and the boroughs to make these routes a success.'",
     "Matt Winfield, London Director for the walking and cycling charity, Sustrans, said:",
     "'Last year's figures demonstrate that investment in Dutch-style cycle routes works - with many schemes boosting cycling levels by over 50% in one year alone.",
     "'The Mayor's Walking and Cycling Commissioner is right to focus the investment where evidence shows it will have the greatest benefits, and start working collaboratively with boroughs to deliver these routes to Dutch standards.",
     "'With cycling and walking levels growing rapidly, the Mayor, TfL and London's Boroughs need to act quickly make our streets to safer, healthier and better places for people.'",
     "Cllr Julian Bell, Chair of the London Councils Transport and Environment Committee, said:",
     "'London Councils has championed cycling infrastructure that helps improve air quality and enables Londoners to travel safely and efficiently around the capital.",
     "'These routes are a positive step in introducing Londoners to the benefits of cycling and living a healthier lifestyle and boroughs will be hoping to see more routes across the capital so that all Londoners can travel in a safer and more sustainable way.'",
