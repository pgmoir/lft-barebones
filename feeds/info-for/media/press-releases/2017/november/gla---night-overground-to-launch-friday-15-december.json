     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Announcement comes as the London Overground celebrates a decade of successful service\"]}",
     "The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has today announced that Night Overground services will begin in east London on Friday 15 December, making travelling at night even easier for thousands of Londoners.",
     "The 24-hour services will operate on Friday and Saturday nights on the London Overground between New Cross Gate and Dalston Junction, extending to Highbury \u0026 Islington next year. This will help Londoners working through the night as well as those enjoying east London's thriving nightlife.",
     "The launch follows the success of the Night Tube which has seen more than nine million journeys and contributed more than Â£170 million to London's economy in its first year.",
     "The announcement comes as London Overground celebrates 10 years of successful service. Since its launch in November 2007, London Overground has grown to be the third largest rail operator in the UK, providing a vital transport link for millions of Londoners, creating an orbital route around inner London and serving 23 of the Capital's boroughs, as well as southern Hertfordshire.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said\u003c/strong\u003e : \"The Overground has transformed travel across the capital in the last 10 years, opening up areas of London and setting a new standard for quality of service on the rail network. We continue to improve the service every year and I'm delighted that we can bring night services to the East London line for the first time ever next month. The Night Tube has proven such a success with Londoners, I know the Night Overground will help thousands more who are working through the night or out enjoying our capital's nightlife.\"",
     "The London Overground launched in 2007 by taking over from Silverlink Metro services. In the last 10 years TfL has expanded the network taking on three further lines, increased the frequency and capacity of trains, reduced delays, ensured all stations are staffed, improved accessibility, introduced Oyster and contactless, and opened six new stations. This has seen passenger numbers rise from 33 million in 2008/09 to more than 189 million in 2016/17.",
     "Further improvements in the coming years include an extension of the Gospel Oak to Barking line to the Barking Riverside development, electrification of the Gospel Oak to Barking line, the introduction of 45 new air-conditioned walk-through trains on West Anglia lines, and the upgrade of ticket machines across the network.",
