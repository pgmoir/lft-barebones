     "Transport for London's (TfL's) new analysis uses the last three years of casualty figures on the TfL road network to identify the junctions with the poorest safety records so that they can be targeted for work. This analysis will now continue each year as part of a new approach that will see work continually monitored and the junctions with the most incidents prioritised.",
     "The list of 73 junctions is now being considered in detail to assess what can be done to make them safer. The current list includes some that have had work recently completed, some have work planned, and others require new safety studies.",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"21 junctions have had significant improvements made within the last three years. These will now be monitored to ensure that the casualty levels significantly reduce and that lessons are learnt to improve the future design and construction of projects.\",\"33 junctions have improvements planned within TfL's current business plan. This includes Lambeth Bridge North and Waterloo IMAX which will be consulted on this summer. Design work on other junctions within the list of 73 continues at pace, including Jamaica Road/Lower Road/Rotherhithe Tunnel, which will be part of Cycle Superhighway 4, and Highbury Corner, where construction work is due to start next year.\",\"19 junctions will undergo new safety studies to identify possible solutions and safety improvements. This includes locations such as Holloway Road and Parkhurst Road, Clapham Road and Union Road and Hyde Park Corner and Park Lane.\"]}",
     "Walking and Cycling Commissioner, Will Norman, said: `It's vital that we target the most dangerous junctions across London if we are to improve our roads for pedestrians and cyclists. That's why I asked TfL to identify these junctions and why we're now analysing them in detail to ensure that we are doing all we can to make them safer. This work will allow us to drive forward improvements and be repeated each year to ensure that our work is making a real difference to the Capital's roads.'",
     "Ben Plowden, TfL's Director of Surface Strategy and Planning, said: `We're committed to improving road safety in the Capital and we will only achieve this and encourage more people to walk and cycle if we address safety at many of our road junctions. This new analysis will allow us to target our efforts where it is most needed, and will allow us to closely monitor the effectiveness of what we deliver to ensure we're always learning from our projects.'",
     "German Dector-Vega, Director for Sustrans in London, said: `We welcome this continuing vital work to make the Capital's most dangerous junctions safer for everyone. It is critical that we see rapid progress to make walking and cycling easier and safer if we want London to be a healthier place.'",
     "Improving the safety of the Capital's junctions is a central part of the Mayor's Â£2.1bn Healthy Streets approach. This aims to create more attractive, accessible and people-friendly streets, where everybody can enjoy spending time and being physically active by making walking and cycling easier and safer across London.",
     "TfL's new 'Vision Zero' approach to reducing road danger is part of the Mayor's forthcoming Transport Strategy. This means vigorously enforcing traffic law, putting safety at the core of road engineering projects and working to discourage dangerous behaviour on the roads.",
