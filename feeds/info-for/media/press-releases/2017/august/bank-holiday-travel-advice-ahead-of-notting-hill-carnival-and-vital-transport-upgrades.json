     "Nigel Holness, Director of Network Operations for London Underground, said: `This will be a busy Bank Holiday weekend in London, with events going on across the city including, of course, the iconic Notting Hill Carnival celebrations. Carnival is an incredible celebration of different cultures and we are proud of all that our staff do every year in helping customers enjoy the festivities safely.",
     "`I encourage all those who plan to take part in Carnival, or any of the other events across London this weekend, to check travel information before starting their journeys. Our website and real-time Twitter accounts will feature all the information customers will need to plan an enjoyable weekend.'",
     "The annual celebration of Caribbean culture and tradition will take place this weekend Sunday 28 and Monday 29 August. It includes a selection of live music, from reggae and soul to dub and house, alongside steel bands and soca floats.",
     "TfL services will continue to keep the Capital moving during the annual three-day event. Its dedicated Carnival webpage has details on how transport services will run, including a map showing the nearest stations and bus routes.",
     "Motorists are advised to avoid driving in the Notting Hill area and West London across the Bank Holiday weekend, as a number of road closures will be in place from Sunday 27 August to early morning on Tuesday 29 August.",
     "The easiest ways to travel to and from the Carnival will be by Tube, bus, cycling or walking. However, some stations close to the Carnival will be closed or will be exit only, and some bus routes will be diverted or stop short of their journey.",
     "Public transport and road users are advised to plan their journeys in advance at \u003ca href=\"http://tfl.gov.uk/notting-hill-carnival\"\u003etfl.gov.uk/notting-hill-carnival\u003c/a\u003e or by contacting the 24-hour London Travel Information line on 0343 222 1234.",
     "Due to road closures and the demand on public transport, customers are encouraged to consider walking part of their journey to and from the Carnival.",
     "Customers can plan their walking journey at \u003ca href=\"http://tfl.gov.uk/journeyplanner.\"\u003etfl.gov.uk/journeyplanner.\u003c/a\u003e ",
