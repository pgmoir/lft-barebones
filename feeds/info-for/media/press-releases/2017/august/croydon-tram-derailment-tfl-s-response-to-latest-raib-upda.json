We will implement a permanent speed reduction across the London tram network by the end of September, meaning the maximum speed trams can travel will be 70kpm (previously 80kph).\",\"Enhanced chevron signs have been installed at the four sites with significant bends to provide an additional visual cue for drivers. The number of speed signs will be increased and additional lineside digital signage will provide added speed warnings to drivers.\",\"An in-cab vigilance device is being trialed and should be fitted to all trams by the autumn.
