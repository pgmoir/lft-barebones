     "A special bus shuttle service is also operating between Epping and Chingford calling at Epping, Debden, Loughton and Chingford providing connections to London Overground services.

     "This dispute concerns the need to move eight train operators on the Central line. These drivers are needed at other depots on the Underground so that London Underground can provide the best possible train service to customers. Following consultation, TfL has minimised the number of drivers affected to eight from originally over 30 and has guaranteed that those required to move will have first preference on any future vacancies at their original location.",
     "These moves are in accordance with TfLs agreements with the RMT and with other unions, which state that employees can be asked to work at any location on the network.  No further moves are planned.",
     "Peter McNaught, Operations Director for the Central line, said:",
     "'I apologise to customers for the disruption that this unnecessary strike is causing. We have made all reasonable efforts to resolve this dispute through talking through the issues with the unions, and we have minimised the number of employees affected from over 30 to eight. All of these moves are within the long-standing agreements we have made with the unions. We call on the RMT to honour this long-standing agreement and join us for more talks to resolve this issue.'",
