     "During the strike action many Tube stations, including most stations in Zone 1, will not open or, in some cases, may open or close at short notice. Where possible, TfL will run services between open stations, which will mostly be at the end of Tube lines outside central London. Customers should check before they travel, allow more time for their journey and avoid the peak times if they can.",

     "During the action, TfL will open as many stations as possible but it is very likely that many, particularly those in Zone 1, will not open at all or will close at short notice. This is because, for safety reasons, stations deep underground cannot be kept open unless a minimum number of staff are present. TfL will, however, try to open some key Zone 1 stations where possible.",
     "TfL will use the services it is able to run to get as many people as close to central London as possible. Bus services, particularly those from National Rail stations, will be exceptionally busy, so customers are advised is to complete journeys from these stations by foot if at all possible. Customers less able to walk are advised to use buses and to allow more time for journeys.

     "Steve Griffiths, London Underground's Chief Operating Officer, said:",
     "'If the strike by the RMT goes ahead we will be working hard to minimise disruption as much as possible and doing our best to help customers travel around the Capital. Tube journeys from 2000 on Sunday 5 February until around 0900 Wednesday 8 February are likely to be severely impacted.",
     "'Our plan is to use the services we are able to run to get as many people as close to central London as possible. There will be posters, digital boards and announcements in stations to keep people informed of the latest level of service and all customers are advised to check before they travel using our website and live update tools.",
     "'We have made a proposal to both unions in order to end this dispute and will be recruiting at least 650 new station staff this year, of which 325 will be additional new roles. I urge the RMT to keep talking with us and not disrupt the lives of Londoners.'",
