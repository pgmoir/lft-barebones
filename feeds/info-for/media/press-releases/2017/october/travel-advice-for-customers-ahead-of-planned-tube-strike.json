     "Over 200 extra buses and additional Santander Cycle hubs will be provided and extra staff and TfL ambassadors will be on hand across London to help Londoners seek alternative routes.",
     "TfL has been working with the FA to set up a range of additional transport options to help supporters get to and from England's World Cup qualifier against Slovenia on Thursday.",
     "Those travelling to Wembley should allow substantially more time for their journeys. Detailed travel advice is available here: \u003ca href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/campaign/tube-strike?cid=tube-strike\"\u003etfl.gov.uk/tube-strike\u003c/a\u003e ",

     "TfL has met its commitments and has been in constructive discussions with ASLEF at the conciliatory service ACAS in order to resolve this dispute.",
     "Nigel Holness, Director of Network Operations for London Underground, said: 'Should the planned strike action go ahead there will be substantial disruption.",
