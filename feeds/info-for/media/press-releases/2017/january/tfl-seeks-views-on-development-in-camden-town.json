     "Transport for London (TfL) has launched a public consultation seeking feedback on proposals to build above a new Camden Town Tube station entrance on Buck Street.",
     "Camden Town Tube station is one of the busiest interchange stations on the London Underground. With increasing customer numbers on the Northern line, which now includes a 24-hour service on Fridays and Saturdays, the 85,000 people who use the station each day is set to increase by 42 per cent in the evening peak alone over the next five years.",
     "TfL plans to modernise Camden Town Tube station by making it more spacious and accessible and creating a new entrance on Buck Street to meet the growing demand of customers and support the local economy.",
     "Last year, TfL held the first phase of public consultation to find out what people thought about upgrading the Tube station, including introducing the new entrance. Over 1,700 people responded and 95 per cent supported the need to improve the capacity of the station.",
     "TfL also has plans to develop above the new station entrance to provide up to 60-70 new homes, while working with Camden Council to provide improvements to the public realm around the new proposed entrance. It is expected that 35 per cent or more of the homes will be affordable housing, as part of TfL's overall target for 50 per cent affordable housing across its sites. TfL will seek planning permission to build above the proposed new station entrance from Camden Council next year, and there will be further opportunity for people to comment formally as part of the planning application process.",
     "Graeme Craig, Director of Commercial Development for TfL said:",
     "'Many of our stations, like Camden Town Tube station, are at the heart of London's neighbourhoods. Providing development above and around the station to include up to 70 new homes and commercial and retail space, will enable us to support the thriving local area while generating vital, non-fare revenue to reinvest in transport.'",
     "Mark Wild, Managing Director of London Underground said:",
     "'Modernising Camden Town Tube station will make it easier for the tens of thousands who use this station every day by creating a more spacious station and introducing much needed step-free access from street to train. It will also enable us to continue to meet the growing demand of customers in the area for years to come.'",
     "TfL is working closely with Camden Council on these proposals. Subject to funding and permissions, work on the station and potential development could start in the early 2020s.",
     "TfL has previously announced that it is seeking to build 10,000 new homes at 75 sites over 300 acres across London. As well as working with traditional larger developers, additional sites will be developed in conjunction with small and medium size enterprises and Community Land Trusts - helping to diversify the pool of people and businesses that benefit from London's growth.",
