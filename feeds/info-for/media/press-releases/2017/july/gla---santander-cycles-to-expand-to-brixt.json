     "This press release, issued by the Mayor of London, was first published on \u003ca href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/santander-cycles-to-expand-to-brixton\"\u003elondon.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e ",
     "The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has today announced that the hugely popular Santander Cycles scheme will expand to Brixton later this year, making cycling easier and more accessible for tens of thousands more Londoners.",
     "Seven new docking stations, providing space for up to 200 bikes, are to be installed across Brixton after funding was agreed with Lambeth Council.",
     "The scheme is already one of the one of the largest cycle hire schemes in Europe and this extension will expand its reach south from Stockwell.",
     "The expansion builds on last year's installation of eight new docking stations at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, and comes after a record-breaking 2016, which saw an unprecedented 10.3m hires - 4.4 per cent up on 2015. This year there has already been more than 5m hires, with five of the six months beating year-on-year records for the number of journeys being made.",
     "Later this summer, TfL will also introduce a next-generation bike for Santander Cycles manufactured by Pashley that retains the popular features of the existing model but will be more manoeuvrable with smaller wheels, a lower frame, a new gear hub and a more comfortable seat.",
     "The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: `I'm thrilled that we are expanding our iconic cycle hire scheme to Brixton. We're working hard to make cycling more accessible across London and this will make a real difference to those living in, working in or visiting Brixton. It's another step forward in our work to improve air quality and the health of all Londoners.'",
     "Will Norman, London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, said: `Santander Cycles are a great way to get all abilities cycling, so I'm delighted that we can expand their reach to Brixton. The record-breaking scheme continues to grow in popularity and with new bikes being introduced this summer, we can be sure it will help even more Londoners enjoy healthy and active travel around the capital.'",
     "Councillor Jennifer Brathwaite, Cabinet Member for Housing \u0026 Environment, Lambeth, said: `Extending the bike hire scheme further south into the borough is excellent news for Brixton and something we have campaigned for a long time. I'm delighted that the Mayor is as committed as we are about improving cycling infrastructure and making it easier for people to swap their cars for more active modes of transport. This all helps to make people fitter and healthier, reduces the congestion on our roads that is contributing to such poor air quality, and reduces the burden on other forms of public transport. I'd encourage everybody to give it a try and get cycling.'",
     "Ashok Sinha, CEO, London Cycling Campaign, said: `The Mayor and TfL are rightly setting out how they will encourage cycling by making the road environment safer. But enabling people to switch between walking, cycling, and public transport in an affordable and seamless way - reducing car dependence and overcrowding on buses and tubes - is also essential to making the capital a greener, healthier city. Convenient cycle access on-demand helps achieve this, which is why it is fantastic news that the Santander Cycle Hire scheme is being extended to Brixton. The London Cycling Campaign looks forward to the day when cycle hire on demand is available throughout Greater London.'",
     "Paul Cowperthwaite, TfL's General Manager responsible for Santander Cycles, said: `Having broken records in 2016, and five months so far in 2017, Santander Cycles has helped millions of Londoners to get cycling. This exciting expansion to Brixton coupled with new and improved bikes launching soon, will help more Londoners of all backgrounds, ages and abilities to discover the benefits of cycling.'",
     "Keith Moor, Chief Marketing Officer at Santander, said: `We are delighted to see the roll out of Santander cycles to Brixton residents, further fulfilling our commitment to help people and communities prosper. More and more people are using the cycles, which provide a quick and easy way to travel around the city and really enjoy London life.'",
     "Encouraging people to cycle is one of the key components of the Mayor's Transport Strategy, which adopts a Healthy Streets approach to help Londoners lead healthier and more active lives. The strategy aims to increase the proportion of people using active and sustainable travel options, and to create streets less dominated by motorised traffic.  This includes providing a world-class cycle hire scheme, which will help Londoners get about quickly without having to use a car - benefiting their health and improving air quality.",

     "Notes to Editors:",
     "The locations of the new docking points will be confirmed later this year. This expansion will bring the total number of docking stations within the scheme to more than 780 and 11,500 bikes",
     "Photos are available \u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tflpress/sets/72157683533343011\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e ",
     "Santander Cycles now covers 100 square kilometres of London, making it the second largest cycle hire scheme in Europe. Since launching in July 2010, more than 60 million journeys have been made. The scheme goes from Hammersmith in the west to Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in the east, and Camden in the north and Brixton in the south.",
     "Last year saw three new records set for weekend hires, with July 30 and 31 becoming the scheme's busiest ever with 92,527 hires. July 2016 was the hire scheme's best ever month overall at 1.2m hires. January, February, March, April and June this year have all broken year-on-year monthly records. In June alone there was 1.1m hires.",
     "More than 1.5m hires have now been made using the Santander Cycles app, which was launched in May 2015 to make it easier to find and hire bicycles. The free app is available on the iTunes and Android App Stores, searching for Santander Cycles",
     "Santander Cycles can be hired from as little as Â£2 a day for an unlimited number of 30 minute journeys. To find your nearest Santander Cycles docking station, visit \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/santandercycles\"\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk/santandercycles\u003c/a\u003e ",
     "The next generation Santander Cycles being built by Pashley will feature a new gear hub for smoother shifting, more comfortable gel saddle, smaller 24\" wheels and 10mm lower frame."
