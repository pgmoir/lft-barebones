     "Transport for London (TfL) is welcoming bids from the open market to create a joint venture partnership to sensitively restore and develop South Kensington Tube station. The Tube station is an iconic gateway to one of London's most beloved cultural quarters and the future development will be respectful to the character of the local area. This scheme will provide vital funds to provide step-free access to the District and Circle line via a new station entrance on Thurloe Street. The scheme will also deliver step-free access to the pedestrian subway leading to local destinations including the Science Museum, Imperial College, the Natural History Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum.",
     "South Kensington Tube station, located in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, welcomes over 34 million District and Circle and Piccadilly line customers a year to London's museum quarter.",
     "TfL plans to improve the commercial and retail units of the station and refurbish the four storey buildings at 20-34 Thurloe Street, with the potential to place a single storey on the distinctive Bullnose building and create new opportunities along TfL's stretch of land on Pelham Street. The site also includes the main station entrances through the Grade II listed shopping arcade, which will be restored to its original state, and a second entrance via a Grade II listed pedestrian subway.",
     "TfL is aiming to identify a partner later this year. TfL and the chosen partner will then form a joint venture to develop proposals for the site in consultation with the local community and seek planning permission to develop the site. Subject to planning, the development including step-free access to the District and Circle line and the pedestrian subway could be complete in 2022.",
     "Separately, TfL is continuing to progress plans to rebuild a disused platform for eastbound District and Circle line services. The ticket hall and gate line will be expanded and a new emergency exit to the road bridge leading onto Thurloe Square bridge will be opened. Subject to planning permission, works could start early next year.",
     "Graeme Craig, Director of Commercial Development Director at Transport for London said:",
     "'South Kensington Tube station is one of our busiest stations and also the gateway to some of the most important and treasured cultural institutions anywhere in the world. We want to find a long-term partner with whom we can work to create a station that reflects its historic legacy and unique setting, whilst generating vital revenue to reinvest in transport and provide step-free access for millions of journeys.'",
