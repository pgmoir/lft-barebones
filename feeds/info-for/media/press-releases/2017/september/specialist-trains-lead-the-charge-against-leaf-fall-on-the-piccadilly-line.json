     "A robust action plan to tackle leaf fall on the Piccadilly line is well underway for the Autumn months, TfL confirmed today.",
     "It follows the publication of an independent report, commissioned by TfL, into leaf fall issues on the Piccadilly line that have led to delays and disruption on the line over the past two years.",
     "Two 1973-stock trains have been converted into specialist engineering trains which will travel on the Piccadilly line treating rails to reduce the risk of poor adhesion. The adhesive material they dispense helps the train wheels grip the tracks during braking. When trains brake on slippery tracks it can cause the wheels to lock and subsequently wear down, an issue known as wheel flats.",

     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Developing a new Autumn timetable which allows for a reduction in train speeds in areas where low adhesion is expected, to reduce the risk to train wheels. This is in line with industry best practice and put in place every year on the Metropolitan line and Network Rail services\"]}",

     "Nigel Holness, London Underground's Director of Network Operations, said: \"Following disruption for Piccadilly line customers in previous years due to leaf fall, we are determined to learn from past experiences and employ every measure possible to tackle the issue effectively this year.",
     "\"This includes introducing two specialist engineering trains that are designed to improve rail adhesion, and carrying out a significant trackside vegetation clearance programme which is already nearing completion.  In line with good industry practice we are also introducing a new Autumn timetable to reduce the risk to train wheels.",
     "\"We are confident that this approach will help reduce any possible delays and provide our customers with the level of service they expect.\"",
