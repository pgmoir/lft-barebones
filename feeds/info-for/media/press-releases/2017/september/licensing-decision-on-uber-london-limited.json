Private hire operators must meet rigorous regulations, and demonstrate to TfL that they do so, in order to operate.  TfL must also be satisfied that an operator is fit and proper to hold a licence.",
     "TfL has concluded that Uber London Limited is not fit and proper to hold a private hire operator licence.",
