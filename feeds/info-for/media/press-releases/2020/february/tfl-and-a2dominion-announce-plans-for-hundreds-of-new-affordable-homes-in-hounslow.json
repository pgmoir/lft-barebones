     "TfL has announced that it is working with A2Dominion to bring forward plans to deliver around 400 new affordable homes in Hounslow, details of which will be shared with the public later this week.",
     "The proposals, which cover a 1.48 hectare site, have been designed by HKR architects and include the delivery of around 400 new affordable homes across four buildings. The homes will consist of 1, 2, 3 and 4 bedroom properties.",
     "They will be a mixture of both shared ownership, which offers an affordable route into homeownership, and London Affordable Rent, which provides low-cost rented homes to support low-income households.",
     "The rent levels for London Affordable Rent are set by the Mayor of London and are substantially below open market rents. The site is being designed with a sustainable focus and includes the planting of new trees and a range of biodiverse planting across the development.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Improved pedestrian and cycling facilities\"}",
     "The development will provide a range of benefits for the local community, including improved pedestrian and cycling facilities, such as cycle parking.",
     "There will also be a new public square and gardens for the local community and around 1,400 sqm of retail space created, which will help support the wider local economy.",
     "Being located directly next to Hounslow West Underground station, which is on the Piccadilly line, as well as a number of bus routes, the development will also enable new residents to easily travel across the capital using public transport.",
     "The designs will ensure that the station's Grade II-listed ticket hall is preserved and kept at the centre of the proposals. The new station concourse, which will be built as part of the development, will also allow for improved step-free access via lifts to be provided in the future.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eJonathan Cornelius, Head of Property Development, at TfL, said\u003c/strong\u003e : 'We're excited to share our initial proposals to deliver hundreds of new affordable homes in Hounslow, working with A2Dominion.",
     "'We're looking forward to engaging with the local community on our plans, which also include a variety of improvements for the local area, including a new public square and gardens and cycle parking.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"TfL's housing programme\"}",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eDanny Lynch, Director of Land and Director, A2Dominion, said\u003c/strong\u003e : 'This scheme brings high-quality affordable housing to Hounslow West. It also retains the listed station building and provides new public streets and spaces.",
     "'Hounslow is a very important borough for us, having provided homes in the area for over 70 years we have developed a very strong relationship with the council. Through schemes like this, we expect that relationship to strengthen further in the future.'",
     "These proposals form part of TfL's housing programme, which will provide 10,000 homes across the capital as well as a commitment to deliver 50% affordable housing across all sites brought to the market since May 2016.",
     "Work has already started on more than 1,300 homes in the capital, as the programme continues to build momentum.",
