     "TfLÂ is reminding Tube customers that service on Bakerloo line will be severely affected should planned strike action go ahead from tomorrow, Friday 21 February, until Monday 24 February.",
     "The action, which is planned by train drivers who are RMT members, will mean that customers should complete journeys on the Bakerloo line by 12:00 tomorrow.",
     "There is likely to be little or no service until Monday late afternoon, with delays to any service that is operating. We expect to be running a service from around 16:00 on Saturday to around 14:00 on Sunday.",
     "The dispute is about a new timetable on the Bakerloo line. TfL has worked with its unions to take steps to improve the experience of drivers on the current timetable and has also brought forward work to introduce a new timetable. The new timetable will begin operating next month.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eNick Dent, London Underground's Director of Line Operations, said\u003c/strong\u003e : 'We apologise to our customers for the disruption that this strike will cause on the Bakerloo Line.",
     "'We have met with the RMT on several occasions to outline the steps we have taken to address their concerns with the current timetable, and we have committed to introducing a new timetable next month to resolve these concerns.",
     "'There is no need for the RMT to carry out this strike action, which will cause disruption to Londoners. I call on them to withdraw the action and help us provide the Tube service that London deserves.'",
     "There will be closures on the Circle, District, Hammersmith \u0026 City and Metropolitan lines this weekend for testing of the new signalling system that will hugely increase capacity on the lines once completed.",
     "The Northern line will also be closed between Moorgate and Kennington due to vital work on the Bank Tube station upgrade, while there are partial closures on London Overground services from Euston on Sunday.",
     "TfL apologises for the disruption this will cause.",
     "These vital planned closures, together with the Bakerloo line strike, will mean that only the Jubilee line will be serving Baker Street with services through to central London from this station.",
     "Customers will be able to interchange to the Jubilee line at the station, but it is expected to be exceptionally busy.",
     "Customers should allow more time to complete journeys or change to a different line where possible. Stations such as Oxford Circus, Green Park, Waterloo, Piccadilly Circus and Embankment will also be busier than usual.",
     "Customers who wish to travel between Wembley and central London can take the number 18 bus, while the number 182 links Brent Cross to Harrow.",
     "London Overground and both bus routes may be busier than usual, so customers should plan extra time for journeys using these services.",
     "TfL Travel Ambassadors will be at key locations to provide travel information and advise customers affected by this action. Customers can keep up-to-date with the latest service information in a variety of ways, including:",
