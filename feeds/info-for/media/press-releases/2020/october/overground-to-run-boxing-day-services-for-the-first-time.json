     "Customer journeys during the holiday period are set to become even easier as Transport for London (TfL) has announced London Overground is to run Boxing Day services on parts of its network for the first time.",
     "This year, on Thursday 26 December, services will operate from Highbury \u0026 Islington to West Croydon and Clapham Junction to Hackney Wick, complementing existing London Underground, Docklands Light Railway (DLR), tram and bus services.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eRory O'Neill, TfL's General Manager for London Overground, said:\u003c/strong\u003e ",
     "'The introduction of Boxing Day services on the London Overground is great news for our customers. Whether you are off to visit family and friends or to bag yourself a bargain from the sales, off peak fares will apply all day giving best value for money so you can make the most of the holidays with our help.'",
     "Due to the need for Network Rail to undertake essential maintenance work, much of which is done during quieter periods such as the festive period, London Overground services on Boxing Day may vary slightly each year.",
     "TfL will now operate services 364 days a year, excluding Christmas Day, on London Overground, London Underground, London Trams, DLR, London Buses and the Emirates Air Line.  Santander Cycles, Dial a Ride and services from Victoria Coach station continue to be available every day.",
     "Since TfL launched London Overground in 2007 it has been a huge success and grown to become the third largest operator in the UK in terms of passenger numbers.  The introduction of Boxing Day services continues to build on the increasing demand, which has seen passenger numbers rise from 33 million in 2008/09 to more than 189 million a year today.",
