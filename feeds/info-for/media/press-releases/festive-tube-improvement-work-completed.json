     "Customers will benefit from this huge amount of work and investment later this year when the first section of the new signalling system goes live between Hammersmith and Latimer Road and when the new Hammersmith Control Centre opens.",
     "The work to introduce new signalling on four lines - the Hammersmith \u0026 City, District, Circle and Metropolitan - means that journeys will be improved across 40 per cent of the London Underground network. Journeys will be made quicker, less crowded and more reliable, with capacity on the lines increasing by 33 per cent.",
     "The modernisation is a key part of the Mayor's Transport Strategy to make London a greener, more accessible place. It will help deliver the Mayor's target of 80 per cent of journeys made by public transport, cycling or walking by 2041.",
     "Work continues apace on the Northern Line Extension with the building of new stations at Battersea and Nine Elms progressing well.",
     "Significant progress is also being made with plans to introduce 250 new air conditioned trains on the 'Deep Tube' as TfL announced that it expects to award the contract for the new trains later this year.",

     "'The work we completed over the festive period was incredibly complex and I thank customers for their patience whilst our engineers worked around the clock to carry it out. This work is part of our record investment in the Tube, which will see over forty per cent of the network radically improved with more frequent trains, quicker journeys and better reliability and the first major extension to the Tube network since the 1990s.'",
