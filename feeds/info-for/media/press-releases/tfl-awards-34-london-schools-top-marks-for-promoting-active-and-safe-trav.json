     "Transport for London (TfL) today gave top awards to 34 London schools for championing active and safe travel on the journey to school, as part of its STARS (Sustainable Travel: Active, Responsible, Safe) schools programme.",
     "The schools received awards for being the highest performing of more than 1,500 participating London schools, in reducing car use, increasing walking and cycling and using public transport.",
     "TfL's STARS scheme helps primary and secondary school children adopt safe and sustainable ways of travelling, such as cycling, walking and public transport. Now in its tenth year, accreditation to STARS has grown from 180 schools in 2006 to 1,557 in 2016. Schools are judged on their success in changing travel behaviour with each school awarded a Bronze, Silver or Gold accreditation.",
     "Mayor Sadiq Khan signed the certificates which were presented to the top performing schools at the annual event at City Hall.",
     "Deputy Mayor for Transport, Val Shawcross, said: `We're working hard to create more attractive, accessible and people-friendly streets and I'm delighted that so many schools across London have been spending their time encouraging active and safe travel too. These top 34 schools have shown particular innovation and should be proud of their achievements. I hope all involved continue to inspire families to enjoy walking, cycling and public transport, and help us reduce car dependence.'",
     "Leon Daniels, TfL's Managing Director of Surface Transport, said: `With the help of our STARS programme, we are delighted children are championing sustainable ways of travel, the importance of air quality, and road and personal safety. School accreditation has grown impressively, and it's great to have every London borough on-board for the first time. We are especially proud of the top performing schools for leading by example to inspire others to help make our streets healthier and safer.'",
