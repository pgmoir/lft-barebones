     "Other stations and lines that will also be much busier include TfL Rail services between Romford and Stratford, particularly Ilford station, and London Overground lines and stations between Liverpool Street and Chingford. The Victoria line will be much busier than usual, particularly Walthamstow Central, as will the Jubilee line between London Bridge and Waterloo. Customers may have to queue outside stations during peak times to prevent overcrowding, and it may take longer than usual to board a train.",
     "A special bus shuttle service will be operating between Epping and Chingford calling at Epping, Debden, Loughton and Chingford providing connections to London Overground services. TfL is boosting local bus services in areas which will not have a Central line service.",
     "There will be posters, digital boards and announcements in stations around the network and customers are advised to check before they travel at tfl.gov.uk/tube-strike and use TfL's live update services - @TfLTravelAlerts, @TfLTrafficNews and @TfLBusAlerts on Twitter.",
     "This dispute concerns the need to move eight train operators on the Central line.  These drivers are needed at other depots on the Underground so that London Underground can provide the best possible train service to customers.  Following consultation, TfL has minimised the number of drivers affected to eight from originally over 30 and has guaranteed that those required to move will have first preference on any future vacancies at their original location.",
     "These moves are in accordance with TfL's agreements with the unions, which state that employees can be asked to work at any location on the network.  No further moves are planned.",
     "Peter McNaught, Operations Director for the Central line, said:",
     "'I apologise to customers for the disruption that this unnecessary strike will cause.  We have made all reasonable efforts to resolve this dispute through talking through the issues with the unions, and we have minimised the number of employees affected from over 30 to eight.  All of these moves are within the longstanding agreements we have made with the unions.  We urge them to engage with us to resolve this issue and to withdraw the strike action, which will only cause needless disruption to Londoners.'",
