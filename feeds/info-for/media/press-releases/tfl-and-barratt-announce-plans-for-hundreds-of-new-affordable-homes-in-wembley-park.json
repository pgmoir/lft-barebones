     "TfL has established a joint venture partnership with Barratt London and will be sharing their proposals this week to deliver around 450 new homes, with 50% affordable housing, in Wembley Park.",
     "The proposals, which cover a 1.6-acre site, have been designed by TateHindle architects and include the delivery of around 450 new homes across five buildings. The homes will be a mixture of studio, one, two and three-bedroom properties.",
     "The affordable homes will be offered as a combination of shared ownership and rented property to households on low income with prices based on social rent levels.",
     "The proposals will also provide new commercial space and public realm improvements for the local community. The site is located within the Wembley Growth Area, which seeks to provide at least 11,500 new homes and approximately 10,000 new jobs by 2026.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Sustainable transport\"}",
     "The development's location will enable new residents to travel across the capital easily using public transport as it is situated next to Wembley Park London Underground station, which is serviced by both the Jubilee and Metropolitan lines, as well as a number of bus routes.",
     "The proposals will also include the provision of cycle parking to support travel by more sustainable modes of transport.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eJonathan Cornelius, Head of Property Development, at TfL, said:\u003c/strong\u003e 'It is fantastic to be working with Barratt London on this opportunity to deliver hundreds of high-quality new homes in Wembley, with 50% affordable housing, as well as providing a range of improvements to the area for the local community.",
     "'Following our very positive experience working with Barratt London on Blackhorse View in Waltham Forest, we look forward to engaging with people in Brent and hearing their feedback on our plans to help tackle the housing crisis and provide improvements for the local community.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Fantastic enhancement\"}",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eMatt Calladine, Regional Land and Development Director, Barratt London, said:\u003c/strong\u003e 'The site at Wembley Park station is an important development site in the context of the wider Wembley regeneration area.",
     "'We are looking forward to working closely with TfL, the London Borough of Brent and local stakeholders to ensure the delivery of high-quality homes and mixed-use accommodation, that will be a fantastic enhancement to the local area.'",
     "These proposals form part of TfL's housing programme, which will provide 10,000 homes across the capital as well as a commitment to deliver 50% affordable housing across all sites brought to the market since May 2016.",
     "Construction has already started on more than 740 homes in the capital and will start imminently in Kidbrooke which will provide more than 600 further homes, as the programme continues to build momentum.",
