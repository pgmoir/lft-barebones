     "Transport for London (TfL) has today unveiled ambitious plans for the redevelopment of London Underground's historic home - the Grade 1 listed 55 Broadway.",
     "The plans propose to transform the iconic building in Westminster from outdated offices to a landmark residential development with adjoining affordable and social housing and improved retail units. The project is part of TfL's radical new plans to generate more non-fare revenue - around £3.5bn - which will all be reinvested into improving London's transport network - TfL will not 'retain' any of it.",
     "Detailed analysis conducted earlier this year identified that a residential led development of 55 Broadway would be the most suitable option to deliver best value for fare and taxpayers and would maintain the heritage of the building, enabling many of its original features to be retained. TfL has delivered a substantial on-site affordable housing provision with 22 per cent of homes affordable, including a number of high quality three bed duplex flats for social housing for families.",
     "Recognising the building's architectural significance, TfL is now leading the work to prepare a planning application for submission next month. Throughout the process TfL has engaged English Heritage to ensure the proposals preserve the building's iconic status.",
     "Graeme Craig, Director of Commercial Development at TfL, said:",
     "'Our aim is to make life in London better and help keep the city working and growing. This means recognising our role as the custodian of one of London's largest and most valuable property portfolios and developing our assets for the benefit of the city.\"All revenue raised from the redevelopment of 55 Broadway and the rest of our commercial activities will be reinvested, enabling us to make journeys better for everyone who uses public transport and the road network, bear down on the fares and charges people are asked to pay, and support economic prosperity in London and the UK.'",
     "Andrew Tate, Director of TateHindle, the architect firm who has prepared the planning proposals said:",
     "'We were excited to have the opportunity of working on Holden's visionary building. The most important interventions happen at ground level and will re-establish Holden's direct route from Victoria Street through to the St James's Park ticket hall, with a resulting increase in amount and quality of the retail space. Removing the 1970s Petty France building will provide a new entrance court creating a natural separation of the residential from the station and retail elements.",
     "'Public realm improvements will greatly enhance the setting of the Grade I listed building, wider, more generous stone paving and swapping the glass from opaque to clear will transform and open up the retail. The restoring of 55 Broadway's striking footprint will also allow views of two of the 'Winds' series of sculptures, that help make the building so memorable.'",
     "With a 5,700 acre property portfolio, TfL is the custodian of one of the largest and most valuable estates in London. TfL is committed to managing and developing this portfolio as part of bearing down on fares while continuing to modernise public transport and the capital's roads.",
     "Creative and innovative steps are being taken to use the five parts of TfL's commercial estate - stations, property, advertising, sponsorship and retail - in order to:",

     "Early next year, TfL will be launching a process to identify a mix of private sector development partners, with whom it will be working over the next decade to transform TfL's huge property portfolio. The property that could be unlocked through this could make a real contribution towards London's rapidly growing population, providing vital new housing for Londoners, new office space, retail opportunities and more, while also generating vital income for TfL over the long-term of the investment. An exhibition on the proposals for the redevelopment of 55 Broadway is open to the public from Tuesday 16 September to Friday 19 September from 11:30-19:00 in retail units14-17 inside St James's Park station. The building, designed by Charles Holden between 1927 and 1929, was constructed as a new headquarters for the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), the main forerunner of London Underground.",

The solution was a cross-shaped layout, allowing pedestrians to walk through the ground floor of the offices, across the station booking hall, providing a short cut between Victoria Street and St James's Park.\",\"Above ground, the building was faced with 78,000 cubic feet of high quality Portland stone.
