     "Local\n        night bus services in the Shoreditch area are to get a further boost from this\n        Saturday (27 September), as Transport for London (TfL) increases the frequency\n        of the N55 to provide extra capacity at weekends to meet increased passenger\n        demand in this busy area.",
     "The\n        route, which operates between Oxford Circus and Woodford Wells via Old Street,\n        Shoreditch, Hackney and Leyton will see weekend night frequency increased from\n        every 15 minutes to every 12 minutes. This will provide a 25 per cent capacity\n        increase on the route at these times.",
     "This\n        follows a number of service improvements in the area earlier this year that saw\n        the weekend service on route N26 increase to a bus every 12 minutes from a 20\n        minute service, and the N205 increase to a bus every 20 minutes from a 30\n        minute service.",
     "John Barry, TfL's Head of Network Development for\n        buses, said: `As Shoreditch's night life continues to grow in\n        popularity we're working hard to provide extra capacity. The improvements to\n        the N55 follow similar changes to the N205 and N26 earlier this year.`",
     "This service change\n        is part of TfL's management and development of a network that comprises around\n        700 routes across Greater London operated by 7,600 buses at peak times,\n        carrying more than 2.4 billion passengers every year. TfL keeps the network\n        under regular review, working with the London boroughs and other partners to\n        help ensure that services can respond to London's changing travel needs.",
