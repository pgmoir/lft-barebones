     "More than one million journeys have now\n        been made using contactless payment cards and devices since Transport for\n        London (TfL) launched the new way to pay for public transport in London last\n        Tuesday, 16 September.",
     "Contactless payments can be made for\n        travel on Tube, tram, DLR, London Overground and National Rail services that\n        accept Oyster as well as London Buses.",
     "Contactless payments have been available\n        on the bus network since December 2012. Since contactless payments launched\n        across transport in London last Tuesday there has been a significant rise in\n        bus journeys using contactless payment, with the highest being 100,000 journeys\n        in a day.\n         \n        The total number of journeys on Tube and\n        Rail services in London has now reached over 375,000 and the total number of\n        journeys on London Buses and Trams since contactless payments launched across\n        transport in London last week is now over 785,000.",
     "There have been over 250,000 instances\n        per day of customers touching a contactless payment card or device on readers\n        across transport in London.",
     "This brings the total number of times customers\n        have touched in or out on the payment readers to 1.6 million since contactless\n        launched last week.",
     "Contactless payments are now making up\n        nearly five per cent of all pay as you go journeys on the network with the most\n        popular London Underground stations for contactless currently being Canary\n        Wharf, Oxford Circus, London Bridge, Victoria and Liverpool Street.",
     "Shashi Verma, TfL's Director of Customer\n        Experience, said: `It is really encouraging to see over one million contactless\n        journeys on transport across London in the first week. We want travelling in\n        London to be as easy and convenient for our customers as possible and\n        contactless is one of the steps we have taken to make that happen.`",
     "Using contactless payments for travel is\n        really easy. Customers with a contactless payment card (debit, credit, charge\n        or pre-paid cards) just simply have to touch their card on the reader. There is\n        no need to sign up for an online account with TfL, but there are many benefits\n        if customers choose to, including being able to see 12 months of journey and\n        payment history. Customers who don't have any online account can still access\n        their journey and payment history, but only for the last seven days.\n         \n        Contactless payments work in the same way\n        as Oyster, charging customers an adult-rate pay as you go fare when they touch\n        in and out on readers at the start and end of every journey.",
     "Customers using\n        contactless payments for their travel can benefit from having their fares\n        capped - this automatically calculates the best fare for their contactless\n        travel in a day or over a seven-day period from Monday to Sunday.\n         \n        Oyster will continue to be available,\n        with contactless payments being another option that lets customers travel\n        without the need to top up Oyster credit. The next part of TfL's plans to\n        revolutionise ticketing concentrate on how the benefits of contactless can be\n        brought to Oyster, to ensure all customers experience the same convenience.",
     "Four customers who are using contactless\n        to travel in London talk about why it is the best way to pay for their travel\n        here:",

     "Card clash is being closely monitored and\n        customers are being refunded when they may have accidentally touched more than\n        one card on a reader and paid with a card they did not intend to use. On\n        average there have been around 1,700 instances each weekday where customers may\n        have accidentally paid with a contactless payment card they did not intend to\n        pay with and all of these are being automatically refunded by TfL. This figure\n        compares with a pre-launch estimate of around 2,000 - less than 0.1 per cent of\n        the smartcard rail journeys made in London every day.",
