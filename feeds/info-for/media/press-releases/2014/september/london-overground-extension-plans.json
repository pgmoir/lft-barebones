     "Transport for London (TfL) is seeking public views in an initial consultation on plans to extend London Overground services on the Gospel Oak to Barking line to a new station at Barking Riverside.",
     "Barking Riverside is the largest housing development in east London, with planning permission for up to 10,800 new homes, as well as healthcare, shopping, community and leisure facilities.",
     "Significant transport infrastructure must be built to support the development. Without a suitable rail link, no more than 1,500 homes can be built on the 443 acre, former power station site.",
     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said:",
     "'Introducing the services of one of the UK's most punctual and popular railways will fast-track the renaissance of Barking Riverside. Other extensions have proven instrumental in spurring jobs and economic growth - the experience of this part of London should be no different. A link in to the London Overground network and access to central London would without doubt unlock further development in Barking Riverside and help it to realise its full potential.'",
     "TfL's Managing Director of Planning, Michele Dix, said:",
     "'This initial consultation is to enable stakeholders and the local community to give us their views on the proposal and influence the design of the scheme going forward. We will use these to lay the foundations of a full and extensive public consultation in 2015.'",
     "Those wishing to make submissions may do so at \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/gospeloak-barking\"\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk/gospeloak-barking\u003c/a\u003e after 8 September 2014.",
     "In support of a leaflet drop to 27,400 households in the area, TfL is also holding drop-in sessions where staff will be available to answer questions from members of the public. The sessions will be held at Barking Library 1pm-5pm, Saturday 20 September, Thames View Library 2:30pm-7pm Tuesday 23 September and the Rivergate Centre, 3pm-8pm, Monday 6 October.",
