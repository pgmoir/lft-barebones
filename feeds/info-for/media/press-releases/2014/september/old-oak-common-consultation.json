     "Transport for London's (TfL) public consultation on plans for a new London Overground station to support new rail infrastructure and regeneration at Old Oak in west London will open on Monday (September 22).",
     "Old Oak is designated as an Opportunity Area in the Mayor's London Plan, with the potential to create 55,000 jobs and 24,000 homes. Improved local transport infrastructure, including connections to the London Overground network, is essential to support this level of regeneration and will enable up to 250,000 more people to be within an hour's journey of Old Oak, providing them with access to new jobs in the area. The proposals will improve local rail connections as well as alternative options to link with Crossrail 1 and High Speed 2 helping reduce pressure on central London stations.",
     "The proposed HS2, National Rail and Crossrail station will be used by up to 250,000 passengers a day, as many as use Waterloo, and will link two of the country's key rail arteries. To support local development around it, it is critical that improved links between London Overground and the nearby rail networks are made.",
     "The Mayor is also consulting on proposals to create a new Mayoral Development Corporation (MDC) for Old Oak Common and Park Royal. The proposed MDC will look to emulate the success of the London Legacy Development Corporation that continues to lead the post-Olympic regeneration of Stratford and east London.",
     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said:",
     "'The arrival of Crossrail and HS2 provides a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to transform Old Oak into a vibrant new neighbourhood for west London. It's crucial that we get peoples' views about the creation of a fantastic new transport-hub that would see Crossrail and HS2 linked in with a brand new London Overground connection. This vital interchange will catalyse the Old Oak area, taking it from a derelict wasteland into a new city quarter for Londoners and visitors to the capital.'",
     "TfL's Managing Director of Planning, Michèle Dix, said:",
     "'This is an opportunity for locals and rail passengers to have input into a strategic rail interchange for west London. We're looking at three options for the location of a London Overground station at Old Oak and want to hear people's views on these proposals. \"The interchange would improve connectivity, reduce journey times as well as congestion at central London stations and support the regeneration of the Old Oak area.'",
     "TfL is seeking views on the following three options for a new London Overground station at Old Oak:",
     "Option A: London Overground's Clapham Junction to Stratford services diverted to run on a new viaduct. A new station would be built on London Overground's Richmond to Stratford route, adjacent to Old Oak Common Lane, with access to a proposed HS2 station (to the east) and Victoria Road (to the west).",
     "Option B: London Overground services would be diverted to run on existing freight lines into a new station on the London Overground Richmond to Stratford route, with access to the proposed HS2 station (to the east) and Victoria Road (to the west).",
     "Option C: This option would involve the creation of two new stations. A new station would be built on London Overground's Richmond to Stratford route, adjacent to Old Oak Common Lane with a second station on London Overground's Clapham Junction to Stratford route, adjacent to Hythe Rd.",
     "A new London Overground connection in the area will provide passengers with an interchange with HS2 and Crossrail services making journeys easier.

     "TfL is also holding drop-in sessions where staff will be available to answer questions from members of the public. The sessions will be held at:",
