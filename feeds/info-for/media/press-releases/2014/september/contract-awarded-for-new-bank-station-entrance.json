     "Transport for London\n        (TfL)  has awarded the contract to fit out the brand new Waterloo \u0026\n        City line station entrance 'box' at Bank to construction specialists Hochtief\n        UK Limited.",
     "The contract, part of a £57 million major redevelopment at the Bank/Monument\n        interchange, will provide a new step free entrance at the station giving\n        passengers direct access to the Waterloo and City Line from Walbrook Square.",
     "Bank station currently serves 98 million passengers per year and is one of\n        London's busiest Tube stations.",
     "These works form part of London Underground's\n        station capacity programme to enlarge and make step-free the capital's busiest\n        stations.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Northern line redevelopment\"}",
     "In a separate project TfL are also planning to redevelop the Northern\n        line part of the interchange, which includes building a new Northern line\n        southbound running tunnel that will create more platform space, interchange\n        tunnels and an additional station entrance, as well as step-free access to the\n        Northern line platforms.",
     "The Waterloo \u0026 City line station 'box', which is being built by contractors\n        working on media firm Bloomberg's new European headquarters, is an underground\n        structure that will enable the subsequent installation of four new escalators,\n        two new lifts and a new ticket hall. Bloomberg's contractors will hand over the\n        box to London Underground next summer, with the final fit out scheduled to be\n        completed by the end of 2017.",
     "David Waboso, London Underground's Director of Capital Programmes, said: `The\n        award of this contract is an important step on our journey to deliver a bigger\n        and better Bank station that can meet the challenge of increasing demand and\n        help to provide quicker and easier journeys for customers. The step-free\n        Waterloo \u0026 City line entrance and ticket hall, with new escalators and\n        lifts, form a key part of our upgrade plans for Bank, one of London's busiest\n        stations.'",
