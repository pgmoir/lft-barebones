     "Transport for London's (TfL) new sidings facility at Silwood near New Cross Gate is now complete with the installation of stabling sidings for ten trains that are five carriages long, a new signalling system, traction power and staff welfare facilities.",
     "The sidings came into operation over the weekend ahead of the first five-car trains coming into service between Highbury \u0026 Islington and Clapham Junction/New Cross Gate/Crystal Palace and West Croydon later this year.",
     "The sidings will provide overnight stabling for ten trains. Works to extend 13 station platforms to accommodate the running of five car trains has also been completed.",
     "London Overground Director, Mike Stubbs, said:",
     "'Over the weekend the first trains rolled out of passenger service and into the Silwood sidings to be stored overnight following the completion of this brand new facility in just under 17 months.",
     "'The sidings are a key part of London Overground's improvement programme that will enable the introduction of longer trains to carry more passengers and reduce crowding.'",
     "The existing four-car train fleet will start to use the new sidings immediately before the arrival of five-car trains later in the year.",
     "Notes to Editors:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Lengthening trains to five carriages is part of the Mayor's 2012 manifesto.\",\"Demand on London Overground has grown by 135 per cent in the last four years excluding the East London Line and by 300 per cent including it. Further demand growth is forecast by 2020.  London Overground currently uses four carriage trains. Introducing longer, five carriage trains will help TfL meet this continuing rise in demand.\",\"The £320M London Overground Capacity Improvement Programme (LOCIP) includes construction of new sidings near Wembley, modifications at New Cross Gate and Willesden depots and platform extensions across the network.\",\"On some of the underground stations on the Highbury \\u0026 Islington to New Cross line it is not possible to extend the length of the platforms without completely rebuilding the station. Once longer trains are introduced, the last sets of doors at the rear of the train will not open at Whitechapel, Wapping, Rotherhithe and Canada Water. Train and platform announcements and posters will provide advance warning about which doors will not open once the longer trains are introduced.\",\"Pictures available on request\"]}"
