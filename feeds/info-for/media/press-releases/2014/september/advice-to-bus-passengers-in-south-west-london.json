     "Transport for London (TfL) has today issued advice to bus passengers ahead of planned strike action by members of the Unite union, who work for London United, which will affect bus services in south west London on Friday 19 September and Monday 22 September.",
     "Bus services operated by other companies across the capital are unaffected and will operate a normal service.",
     "The strike action will affect bus routes in south west London but also some routes into central London, including the 9/N9, 10, 94, 148 and C1.",
     "Leon Daniels, TfL's Managing Director of Surface Transport, said:",
     "'I'd like to apologise to our customers in advance for any disruption they may face tomorrow and on Monday. If you're travelling in the areas affected then please do make sure that you check before you travel. Our teams will be working hard to get as much information out there as possible using a variety of channels.",
     "'Bus drivers pay and conditions are a matter for London United and Unite to discuss, as it has been for 20 years, and we would urge them to seek a swift and fair resolution for the sake of our passengers.'",
     "London United operates around 50 bus routes in London and the strike action is likely to result in severe disruption on a significant number of routes and some services not running.  Some Tube services in south London are expected to be busier than normal - so customers are being urged to allow a little more time to complete their journeys on Friday and Monday.",
     "Strike action will take place over two 24-hour periods.  The first, between 00:01 and 23:59 on Friday 19 September, will affect bus services on Friday 19 September and night bus services operating on Friday night into the early hours of Saturday 20 September.  Bus services during the day on Saturday 20 September should operate as normal.",
     "The second strike, that takes place between 00:01 and 23:59 on Monday 22 September, will affect bus services on Monday 22 September and night bus services on Monday into the early hours of Tuesday 23 September.  Bus services during the day on Tuesday 23 September should operate as normal.",
     "TfL is calling for Unite and London United to swiftly resolve the dispute so that passengers are not disrupted.  TfL is also deploying extra staff to assist passengers at various locations, including bus stops and bus stations, and to hand out walking maps.",
     "TfL is keeping passengers informed of the status of their services in a range of ways. These include:",
