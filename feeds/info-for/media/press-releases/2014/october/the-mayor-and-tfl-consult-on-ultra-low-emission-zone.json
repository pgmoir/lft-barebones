     "The\n        Mayor and Transport for London (TfL) today launched a public consultation on\n        proposals to introduce the world's first Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) in the\n        capital on 7 September 2020, to significantly improve air quality and in turn\n        the health of Londoners.",
     "The\n        ULEZ consultation, which runs from today until Friday 9 January 2015, is\n        available online at www.tfl.gov.uk/ultra-low-emission-zone",
     "The\n        groundbreaking proposals would require all vehicles travelling within the\n        Congestion Charge zone to meet new emission standards and would be in operation\n        24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Many vehicles would already meet these\n        standards in 2020, however by introducing this requirement next year the Mayor\n        and TfL aim to accelerate the take up of low emission vehicles and stimulate\n        the low emission vehicle market.  The ULEZ will also ensure London's air\n        quality improves more quickly, making the capital a more pleasant place to live\n        and work, and encourage the use of more sustainable forms of transport.\n         \n        The\n        ULEZ is projected to halve emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and\n        particulate matter (PM10) from vehicle exhausts.",
     "This means\n        more than 80% of central London is expected to meet the nitrogen\n        dioxide (NO2) annual legal limits in 2020.  The ULEZ would also\n        lead to a significant reduction in the number of people living in areas of poor\n        air quality (where levels of NO2 exceed legal limits) - by 74% in central London, 51% in inner London and 43% in outer\n        London. \n         \n        NO2\n        is a gas which in high concentrations can cause breathing problems and increase\n        asthma symptoms, with research suggesting that children and young people are\n        most adversely affected as high concentrations of the gas restrict lung\n        growth.",
     "The number of care homes, hospitals and schools exposed to high\n        levels of NO2 would be halved across London.  These positive\n        effects will be especially beneficial to the young, older people and those who\n        have respiratory problems as well as residents of high pollution areas.",
     "The\n        introduction of a ULEZ will not, as some critics suggest, lead to a reduction\n        in air quality or increased congestion outside of the zone.  The majority\n        of traffic entering the ULEZ will be from outside the zone - so the benefits of\n        cleaner, greener vehicles in the form of reduced emissions will be delivered\n        right across London so benefitting Londoners' health.",
     "Boris\n        Johnson, Mayor of London, said: `Introducing the world's first Ultra Low\n        Emission Zone is an essential measure to improve London's air quality and\n        reduce NO2 . Safeguarding Londoners' health and well-being is a top\n        priority for my administration. I understand that people need adequate time to\n        switch to greener vehicles and help is at hand for those who will be hardest\n        hit, but let's be clear, we need to make these important changes ASAP to\n        continue to improve Londoners' quality of life and give everyone who lives in\n        or visits the city the cleanest possible air to breathe.`",
     "The\n        ULEZ proposals would require vehicles travelling in central London to meet the\n        following emissions standards, or pay a daily charge:\n         \n        ·",

     "As\n        part of the ULEZ proposal, TfL is working to reduce emissions from its buses\n        alongside taxis and private hire vehicles and to increase the number of zero\n        emission capable vehicles.",
     "This will create demonstrator fleets in\n        London, boost industry sales and lead the transition towards this technology.\n         \n        By\n        2020, all double deck TfL buses operating in central London will be\n        hybrid and all single deck buses will be zero emission (at point of use). \n        This will require substantial investment by TfL and will mean nearly all double\n        deck buses operating in inner London will be hybrid and many in outer London\n        too.",
     "From\n        2018, it is proposed there will be a new requirement for all taxis and new\n        private hire vehicles presented for licensing in the capital for the first\n        time to be zero emission capable.  Private hire vehicles would also be\n        subject to the ULEZ standards in central London just like other cars and vans\n        (and therefore liable for the charge if they don't meet the emissions standards).",
     "Taxis\n        will be the second largest contributor to NOx and the largest\n        contributor to PM10 emissions from road transport in central London\n        in 2020. The ULEZ proposes to reduce the London-wide age limit for non zero\n        emission capable taxis from 15 years to 10\n        years.",
     "This would substantially reduce emissions from these vehicles\n        across London (by 45% for NOx and 71%  for PM10)\n        and help accelerate the take up of new zero emission capable taxis.\n         \n        In\n        considering the impact of the reduced taxi age limit, the Mayor and TfL are\n        proposing a specific fund to assist taxi drivers to replace their vehicles.  In\n        addition, TfL has been in regular dialogue with the Office for Low Emission\n        Vehicles to ensure their new £500m funding allocation specifically supports\n        taxi and PHV drivers to purchase zero emission capable vehicles, as well as\n        supporting a fund for on-street rapid charging infrastructure.\n         \n        In\n        developing the ULEZ proposal, and in line with the Mayor's aspirations, TfL\n        also considered a 'zero emission capable' ULEZ standard for all other vehicles.\n        However it was concluded that it would not be feasible or affordable to set\n        this requirement for all vehicles for 2020. Nevertheless it is expected that\n        such a standard would be appropriate at a later date (eg 2025) and we are\n        seeking views on this in principle.",
     "Michèle\n        Dix, Managing Director of Planning at TfL, said: \"Improving London's air\n        quality is of paramount importance as it affects the health and well-being of\n        every Londoner.  That's why we are doing everything in our power to\n        address emissions from road transport, with the introduction of an Ultra Low\n        Emission Zone at the core of our work to improve the capital's air.  We\n        would urge everyone who lives, works or travels in London to give us their\n        views on the ULEZ proposal.\"\n         \n        After\n        the consultation closes, TfL will analyse the results of the consultation and\n        make a recommendation to the Mayor. The Mayor will then make a decision on\n        whether to confirm the scheme order, with or without modifications.  As\n        the licensing authority for London's taxi and private hire vehicles, TfL will\n        decide whether to make changes to the licensing requirement for these vehicles.\n         \n        Subject\n        to confirmation of the ULEZ Scheme Order by the Mayor in spring 2015, this\n        would effectively provide a five year notice period prior to the ULEZ coming\n        into operation in 2020 and eight years notice for residents of the zone.",

The Greater\\n            London Authority (GLA) and TfL estimate that a reduction in road transport\\n            emissions of around 70 per cent is needed for central London to meet EU legal\\n            limits for NO2 in 2020, with the ULEZ delivering around two-thirds\\n            of this. In addition to road transport, buildings and construction activity\\n            contribute significantly to London's air pollution.

Vehicle emissions standards refer to total NOx emissions\\n            but EU air quality limit values refer to ambient concentrations and are set for\\n            NO2 as this is the harmful component of the emissions.\",\"The\\n            ULEZ standards would be enforced using Automatic Number Plate Recognition\\n            (ANPR) cameras which are already used for the Congestion Charge. If the daily\\n            charge has not been paid then a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN) would be issued. It\\n            is proposed that for cars, vans and motorcycles this would be set at £130\\n            (reduced to £65 if paid within 14 days) and for HGVs, coaches and buses it\\n            would be set at £1,000 (reduced to £500 if paid within 14 days) - so in line\\n            with the Congestion Charge and Low Emission Zone respectively.\",\"It\\n            is proposed that residents of the ULEZ will be granted a three year sunset\\n            period (until 6 September 2023) before any daily charge applies.
