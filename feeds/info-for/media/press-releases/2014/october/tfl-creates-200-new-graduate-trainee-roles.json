     "Transport\n        for London (TfL) has today announced that it has created over 200 new graduate\n        trainee roles for 2015 as it continues its investment in the next generation of transport professionals.",
     "With its population set to rise from 8.4m today to 10m by 2030, it\n        is vital that London has a transport network capable of keeping the city\n        working and growing and making life in the capital better. A team of dedicated\n        and highly qualified staff is essential to delivering that.\n         \n        In September 2014, TfL welcomed 130 new graduates who are\n        contributing to some of the biggest projects in the world which are vital to\n        the future of the city and the national economy.",
     "As part of a wholesale\n        modernisation of the road and public transport networks, their work includes:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Upgrading some of the country's\\n            busiest and strategically important stations\",\"Expanding transport capacity to\\n            keep the city working and growing\",\"Increasing the safety and\\n            security of TfL's customers, including through radical improvement to\\n            facilities for cyclists in London\",\"Communicating effectively with\\n            its customers and road users to help them make the most of everything London\\n            has to offer and\",\"Making TfL's network accessible\\n            to all.\"]}",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Sir Peter Hendy CBE, said: `London is the economic engine of the UK and our transport system is at the\n        heart of it. With around 30 million journeys undertaken every day, what we do\n        is central to supporting jobs and growth across the UK.  We hire the very best staff to deliver for our customers and\n        users on this massive scale.As part of that, we are recruiting a record 200\n        graduate trainees with a whole range of backgrounds to start in September 2015. With real responsibility given to them from day one, they will ensure that\n        London keeps working and growing to the benefit of the whole country.'",
     "The\n        graduate trainees will support the growth of the transport network by working\n        in roles such as engineering, project management, transport planning,\n        commercial, information management, finance and marketing roles.",
     "In\n        September 2014, 30 per cent of TfL's new graduates were women. Given the broad\n        range of roles that TfL offers, it will also use the next recruitment round to\n        encourage more women to consider a future in the transport industry. In\n        addition to the graduate schemes, TfL also offers apprenticeships, is a sponsor\n        of the Royal Greenwich University Technical College and offers volunteering\n        opportunities to TfL staff  through the Science, Technology,\n        Engineering and Maths Ambassador Scheme where they go into schools to speak to\n        school children about the different opportunities available at TfL.",
     "As\n        well as placements across the organisation, all TfL graduate trainees also\n        spend time in frontline roles across TfL's network to get a first-hand\n        experience of providing Tube, bus, rail and other services to customers.",
     "Since\n        2007, TfL has consistently appeared in the Graduate Times 100 list for best\n        companies to work for, as voted by graduates. TfL\n        was the highest climber in this year's list, moving 36 places up, as well as being voted Employer of Choice in the\n        Transport \u0026 Logistics Award category.",
     "TfL\n        Marketing Graduate trainee, Shelley Hepburn, said: `I have been on the scheme\n        for just over a year now and have had the opportunity to work on a number of\n        different projects, including the consultation of Crossrail 2, the promotion of\n        the Visitor Oyster card and the launch of contactless\n        payments on the London transport network.",
     "'Moving\n        across different departments has given me the chance to work on a diverse set\n        of projects and see the business from a different angle. TfL's graduate scheme\n        is great because you get to see your work helping millions of people across\n        London every day. Anyone looking for a challenge and an opportunity to do work\n        that changes London should definitely apply.'",
     "Crossrail\n        Ltd has also taken on 13 new graduate trainees this September. The trainees\n        will be working on Europe's largest construction project which will transform\n        the rail network in London and the South East when it opens in 2018. The\n        graduate trainees will work alongside the project management team, contractors\n        and designers delivering the Crossrail project.\n         \n        Crossrail\n        Ltd has opened applications for 2015 graduate trainee roles. Successful\n        applicants recruited from degree courses in a range of engineering and\n        commercial disciplines will join a two-year programme.",
     "Dawn Barker, Head of Human Resources at Crossrail said: `Our\n        programme gives graduates a fantastic start to their career and provides them\n        with the opportunity to work alongside some of the UK's best and most\n        experienced professionals in their field. Our graduate trainees won't just help\n        with the delivery of Crossrail, we hope that their talent and skills will go on\n        to benefit future infrastructure projects in London and around the country.`",
     "TfL\n        and Crossrail Ltd are committed to developing and maintaining the skills and\n        talent of their workforce through training, graduate schemes and apprenticeships.\n        The two organisations currently employ over 28,000 employees directly and\n        support nearly 60,000 jobs outside London with 26,500 of those jobs supported\n        in London through their supply chains.\n         \n        Many\n        of these roles are in highly skilled disciplines and TfL and Crossrail Ltd have\n        a vital role to play in making sure these skills are maintained and developed\n        into the future.\n         \n        In\n        the last four financial years, 449 graduate roles have been created by TfL and\n        Crossrail Ltd.",
