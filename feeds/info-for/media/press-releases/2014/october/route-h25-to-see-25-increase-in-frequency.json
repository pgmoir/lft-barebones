     "Local bus services in West London are to get a further boost from\n        this Saturday (18 October), as Transport for London (TfL) increases the\n        frequency of the H25, which is operated by Abellio, to provide extra capacity\n        on the busy route.",
     "The route, which operates between Hatton Cross Station and\n        Hanworth, Butts Farm via Hatton Road, Bedfont Green, Bedfont Lane, Feltham High\n        Street, Hanworth Park, Main Street, Hounslow Road and Saxon Way will see its\n        frequency increased from every 15 minutes to every 12 minutes during\n        Monday to Friday daytimes and Saturday shopping hours.",
     "During all early\n        mornings and evenings the frequency will also be increased from every 30\n        minutes to every 20 minutes.\n        John Barry, TfL's Head of Network Development for buses, said: `Over the past five years demand on this route has\n        increased by around 15 per cent during Monday to Fridays.",
     "We've also seen\n        demand at weekends go up. So we're listening to our passengers and increasing\n        the frequency of our services so that we can best meet their needs`",
     "This\n        service change is part of TfL's management and development of a network that\n        comprises around 700 routes across Greater London operated by 7,600 buses at\n        peak times, carrying more than 2.4 billion passengers every year. TfL keeps the\n        network under regular review, working with the London boroughs and other\n        partners to help ensure that services can respond to London's changing travel\n        needs."
