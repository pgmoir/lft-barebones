     "Transport\n        for London (TfL) has begun work to improve the busy junction at Malden Rushett\n        village as part of its continuing programme of road modernisation.",
     "The\n        work, which began on Monday 22 September and lasts until Spring 2015, will\n        improve road safety and traffic flow at the junction of the A243 Leatherhead\n        Road, B280 Fairoak Lane and Rushett Lane.",
     "New right turn traffic signals and wider roads\n        at Rushett Lane and Fairoak Lane will be delivered as part of the scheme, as\n        well as new direct crossings for pedestrians and advance stop lines for\n        cyclists. Once completed, the works are also expected to improve traffic\n        conditions during the summer, when Chessington World of Adventures Resort is at\n        its busiest\n         \n        In\n        order to deliver the scheme, the works will be done in phases to reduce\n        disruption. TfL will work to ensure that the junction will remain open for the\n        majority of time, reducing the impact the works will have along the main road\n        corridor, but some off-peak and night-time traffic lane closures will be\n        required as the scheme progresses.",
     "The\n        A243 Leatherhead Road will also remain open throughout the works and access to\n        residential addresses and businesses will not be affected, although there is\n        expected to be increased traffic in the area which TfL will work to mitigate\n        through traffic management.\n         \n        As\n        part of the work, the B280 at Fairoak Lane and Rushett Lane will need to close\n        alternately at times to enable improvement works to take place. Temporary\n        traffic lights will be used during the closures and any diversion routes will\n        be clearly signed.",
     "The\n        design process has also identified that, due to the poor condition of the\n        current road surface of the B280 Fairoak Lane, the road needs to be\n        reconstructed as part of these major works. In collaboration with the Royal\n        Borough of Kingston upon Thames, these works have now been incorporated into\n        the major scheme.",
     "Alan Bristow, Director of\n        Road Space Management at TfL, said:",
     "\"This junction in Malden Rushett village is\n        important for businesses and commuters as well as visitors to Chessington World\n        of Adventures. Therefore, it is important that we ensure that this junction\n        stays safe and also keeps traffic flowing.",
     "`We are committed to\n        completing these works as quickly and efficiently as possible and will keep the\n        local community and road users informed of progress as we work to deliver these\n        vital improvements.'",
     "During the next ten years, TfL will be\n        investing around £4 billion into the capital's road network as part of the Mayor's\n        Roads Task Force. Working with its partners, including London's boroughs and\n        road user and street user groups, TfL will build on the improvements already\n        seen in the management of London's roads, streets and public spaces to help\n        ensure the capital remains one of the most attractive, vibrant, accessible and\n        competitive cities in the world.\n         \n        For more information about\n        the works, please visit: \u003ca href=\"https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/streets\"\u003ehttps://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/streets\u003c/a\u003e /malden-rushett",
     "Notes\n        to editors",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"TfL has worked\\n            closely with the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames and Surrey County\\n            Council to ensure any disruption is kept to a minimum.\",\"Preliminary works have been taking place for the\\n            last few months to prepare the worksite including better drainage systems\\n            installed and temporary traffic lights being put in place. Ahead of the\\n            main works, an environmental study has also been undertaken to identify\\n            potential impacts to the local area. Clearance of vegetation will be kept\\n            to a minimum and any hedgerow boundaries affected by the works will be\\n            replaced once the works are completed.\",\"London's roads account for 80 per cent of all\\n            journeys and 90 per cent of all goods moved in the capital. As the engine\\n            of the British economy, London's population is set to grow by almost 2\\n            million to 10 million by 2031 - equivalent to absorbing the population of\\n            both Birmingham and Leeds.\",\"This\\n            is a continual challenge in a city with a road network that developed\\n            organically and was never designed for so much traffic. To meet the challenge,\\n            the Mayor and TfL are investing more than £4 billion in improving London's\\n            roads, streets and urban realm for all road users, residents and businesses\\n            during the next decade.\",\"To help deliver this wider programme of work, TfL\\n            has already begun to expand its innovative SCOOT technology, which can\\n            change traffic signal timings based on traffic levels second by second,\\n            from half of all signals to three quarters of all signals. Hundreds of\\n            staff are already working 24/7 to monitor the network. They will\\n            use London's intelligent traffic light technology to help traffic\\n            movement around these planned bridge closures in west London this summer,\\n            as well as keeping road users up-to-date on traffic conditions.\"]}"
