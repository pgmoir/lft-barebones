     "Local bus services in south east\n        London are to get a further boost from this Saturday (1 November), as Transport\n        for London (TfL) increases the frequency of the 124, which is operated by Stagecoach, and the 185, which is operated by Go-Ahead, to provide\n        extra capacity on these busy routes.",
     "Route 124, which operates between\n        Catford\n        (St Dunstans College) and Eltham (Southend Crescent) via Catford Bridge, Grove\n        Park and Mottingham has seen its frequency increased\n        from every 12 minutes to every 10 minutes during Monday to\n        Saturday.  This represents a 20 per cent increase in capacity.  On\n        Sundays and during all evenings the service has also been increased from a bus\n        every 20 minutes to one every 15 minutes.",
     "These changes came in to effect on Saturday\n        25 October and follow conversations between TfL and local residents and\n        councillors who requested extra capacity on the busy route.",
     "Route 185, which operates between\n        Lewisham (Thurston Road) and Victoria Station via Catford, Forest Hill, East\n        Dulwich, Denmark Hill, Oval and Vauxhall will see its frequency increased from\n        a bus every 10 minutes to one every eight minutes during Monday to\n        Saturday.  This represents a 25 per cent increase in capacity.",
     "This change will come in to\n        effect from Saturday 1 November and has been introduced to respond to high\n        demand in the mornings and afternoons.",
     "John\n        Barry, TfL's Head of Network Development for buses, said: `This is great news for our passengers in south east\n        London - capacity on these routes has increased significantly.  We'll\n        continue listening to our passengers and stakeholders so we can continue to\n        respond to changes in travel requirements'."
