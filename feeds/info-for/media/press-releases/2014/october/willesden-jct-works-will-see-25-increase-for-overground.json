     "Customers are reminded that next week work will begin at Willesden Junction station\n        which will help to deliver a 25% capacity increase on the London Overground network.",
     "It will mean a partial suspension of the Bakerloo line and some London\n        Overground services connecting to Wille \u003ca href=\"Default.aspx#\"class=\"reTool reTool_selected\"title=\"Align Left (CTRL+E)\"unselectable=\"on\"\u003espan\u003c/a\u003e sden Junction for a five day period.",
     "The\n        platform extension work is part of Transport for London's (TfL) continuous\n        programme of investment and delivery of passenger benefits to London Overground\n        and will enable its trains to be lengthened to five carriages. The extension\n        works will take place at Willesden Junction between 29 October and 2 November.",
     "TfL's\n        Director of London Overground, Mike Stubbs,\n        said: `I apologise for the inconvenience caused but these works are essential\n        for the high-performing London Overground service to continue to grow to meet\n        increasing demand. Before we can deliver to passengers a fifth carriage and the\n        benefits of extra space and a more comfortable commute, we need to extend not\n        only the platform at Willesden Junction low level station but also carry out\n        some track work there.",
     "`To\n        help reduce disruption, we have scheduled the work for the mid-term break which\n        always sees reduced numbers of passengers.`",
     "Because\n        the works involve Willesden Junction's Platform 2, Bakerloo Tube line services\n        which use the low level part of the station are also affected.",
     "The\n        works are part of a £320m, 25% capacity increase programme across the\n        London Overground network. To accommodate the longer trains, station platforms\n        across the network are being extended, train depots upgraded and expanded, new\n        train stabling facilities built and alterations made to the signalling system.",
     "London\n        Overground achieved one of the UK's highest scores for passenger satisfaction\n        (91% compared to a national average of 82%) in the results of a\n        survey published earlier this year by independent transport watchdog, Passenger\n        Focus. The railway also regularly scores in the top three places in Network\n        Rail's monthly performance and punctuality tables. In the most recent period 14\n        September to 11 October, 95.7% of London Overground trains reached\n        their terminating station within five minutes of their scheduled arrival time.\n        This compares with the national average for the period of 90.1%.",
