     "Latest performance figures\n        from Transport for London (TfL) show delays on the London Underground (LU) have\n        fallen compared to the same period last year.",
     "Figures published by LU for\n        Periods 3 and 4 (25 May to 19 July) for the current year show that delays on\n        the Tube fell by 8% and 20% respectively, compared to the same\n        periods for last year.",
     "This is a continuation of year-on-year decreases\n        in delays on the Tube and demonstrates that LU remains on track to meet the\n        Mayor's commitment to reduce delays by a further 30% by 2015.\n         \n        The figures follow 2013/14's\n        record performance, when LU carried 1.265bn passengers. Passenger numbers are now\n        up by a third over the last ten years. This continuing trend of long-term\n        improvement on the Tube follows the success of the London Underground\n        Reliability Programme, introduced in 2011.",
     "Phil Hufton, LU's Chief\n        Operating Officer, said: \"Demand for Tube services has never been greater which\n        is why our drive to improve reliability is vital. Customers have already\n        benefited from the upgrades of Jubilee and Victoria lines and work is well\n        underway to modernise the Northern, Circle, District, Hammersmith \u0026 City\n        and Metropolitan lines.",
     "`It is all part of a\n        continuing programme to modernise the Tube with major improvements to stations,\n        trains, track and signalling, which will provide more capacity for the growth\n        of London.`",
     "LU is carrying out a huge\n        programme of modernisation, with major stations, trains, track and signalling\n        being updated or replaced to provide more capacity for a growing city.",
     "The line upgrades are at the core of LU's investment programme, which\n        will deliver more than 30% increase in capacity.  The upgrade\n        programme is being delivered over the coming years, with work to modernise the\n        Northern line nearly complete, and the Circle, District,",
     "Hammersmith \u0026 City\n        and Metropolitan lines well underway.\n         \n        Redevelopment work to\n        increase capacity at key stations and make them step-free is underway at a\n        number of stations including Victoria, Tottenham Court Road and Bond\n        Street.",
     "More than half of LU's 270 stations have now been modernised or\n        refurbished to make them brighter and easier to use, with improvements such as\n        tactile strips, better CCTV and help points, electronic information displays in\n        ticket halls and on platforms and improved seating and lighting.",
