     "London Underground (LU) is operating\n52 per cent of Tube services this afternoon despite the pointless strike called\nby the leadership of the RMT union.",
     "This is far higher than during the\nlast strike in February. LU carried 56 per cent of its usual passenger numbers\ntoday, which is a record for a strike day.",
     "Around 80 per cent of stations are\nopen and services are running on 10 of the 11 lines.",
     "This morning services ran\non all Tube lines during morning peak travel and three Tube lines are running\nservices on their entire line.",
     "Around 90 per cent of Oyster cards\nthat would usually be seen on the TfL network have been seen today - showing\nthat London is again working and open for business.",
     "Barclays Cycle Hire\njourneys are up by over 70 per cent and journeys yesterday reached record\nnumbers since the Olympic Games.",
     "Many thousands of staff and volunteer\nTravel Ambassadors drawn from TfL's support functions are out in force working\nhard to help customers and road users make their journeys.",
     "The strikes have been called by the\nleadership of the RMT union over plans to modernise the Tube.",
     "Under these plans, at the busiest\nstations there will be nearly a third more staff visible and available to\nprovide, on a permanent basis, the face-to-face customer service offered during\nthe London 2012 Games.Visitors to London and people with disabilities will be\nbetter looked after than ever before.",
     "The modernisation will see savings of\nÂ£50 million a year which will be reinvested in more frequent and reliable train\nservices and will help keep fares down.",
     "Safety and security will never be\ncompromised. Safety is not controlled from ticket offices but by station\nsupervisors and dedicated control rooms.",
     "This will continue.",
     "Mike Brown, Managing Director of\nLondon Underground, said:\n\"I'm sorry that Londoners are\nexperiencing more disruption today as a result of the RMT's pointless strike\naction, and I thank our customers for the patience they have shown throughout\nand continue to show.\nWith more\nstaff at work than yesterday, we have been able to run 52 per cent of the train\nservice and keep around 80 per cent of stations open.  We have\ncarried 56 per cent of our normal passengers this morning and nearly ninety per\ncent of the normal number of Oyster cards have been used across the TfL public\ntransport network. We again have a record number of buses operating and\nfull or enhanced services on the London Overground, DLR and Tramlink.\nThe only sensible course is for the\nRMT leadership to call off the strikes and get back to working with us to shape\nthe future of the Tube, as the other three unions are doing.\nUnder our plans to modernise the\nTube, we're committed to a safe railway with an increased number of visible\nstaff - by 30 per cent at our busiest stations - personally serving our\npassengers.  That means more staff than ever on hand providing help for\ncustomers who need it most.  Fairness to our staff is guaranteed.\nThere will be no compulsory redundancies, there is a job for all staff wanting\nto remain with us and no one will lose pay.  We have made significant\nchanges to our original proposals after listening to our people and the unions\nin over 40 meetings.\"",
