     "Under\nLU's plans, the public areas of stations - ticket halls, gate lines and\nplatforms - will effectively become personalised customer service centres,\nreplicating the standards of service LU were able to offer during the London\n2012 Games.",

     "Phil Hufton, London\nUnderground's Chief operating Officer, said: \"Our plans will radically improve\nthe service we offer Tube customers in future. The whole Tube station will\neffectively become a personalised customer service centre, with more staff\nvisible and available to help customers buy the right ticket, plan their journeys\nand get assistance.\n\"Over the past eight\nweeks, we have met with trades unions on more than 40 separate occasions. We have listened to their concerns\nand made changes as a result. We've provided guarantees that not a single\nmember of staff will be forced to leave LU, that no supervisors must 'apply for\ntheir own job' and we are seeking ways to ensure that no member of staff sees\ntheir pay cut as a result of these changes.\nGiven these\ncommitments and guarantees, Londoners will rightly be asking why the RMT is\nthreatening five days of strikes. All it will achieve is disruption to\nLondoners and a loss of pay for all those staff who take part. My message to\nthe RMT leadership is its not too late to call off this unnecessary strike and\ncontinue to work with us to help shape the future of the Tube. However, should\nit go ahead we will be working hard to keep London moving and open for\nbusiness.\"",

     "If your Oyster card needs topping up, it may help to do\nthis in advance of the industrial action starting.",
     "There will be disruption to journeys tomorrow and Wednesday, when\nTube services will start later and finish earlier than normal - where running a\nservice is possible, trains will run from around 07:00hrs or as soon as\npossible after that to around 23:00hrs with no service beyond that.",
