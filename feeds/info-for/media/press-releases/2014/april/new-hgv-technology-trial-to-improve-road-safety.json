     "A new project funded by\n        Transport for London (TfL) will independently test blind spot safety\n        technology, which can be fitted to Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) to help reduce\n        the risk of collisions between HGVs, pedestrians and cyclists.",
     "One of TfL's top priorities\n        is to reduce by 40 per cent the number of people killed or seriously injured on\n        London's roads by 2020.",
     "Recently, the Mayor and TfL published six commitments\n        which, working with a range of partners, are guiding initiatives to deliver\n        this.",
     "In particular, action is being taken to prioritise the safety of the most\n        vulnerable road users:  pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists.",
     "The new safety initiative,\n        which builds on TfL's work into Construction Logistics and Cyclists' Safety,\n        will be carried out by the independent Transport Research Laboratory (TRL).",
     "The\n        project will evaluate the effectiveness of the full range of blind spot\n        safety technology in spotting pedestrians and cyclists. This includes camera\n        monitoring systems, optical and radar detection systems and other sensors\n        fitted to HGVs.",
     "The findings will then be\n        used to create new and detailed performance criteria, such as the distance\n        objects can be detected, how easily the equipment detects vulnerable road\n        users, and how reliable the equipment is, to allow for independent testing and\n        evaluation of products on the market today.",
     "Companies will be able to\n        use the new standard testing criteria to make a more informed choice about the\n        types of safety equipment they invest in for their fleet vehicles.",
     "It will also\n        help ensure a wider take-up of the best equipment while encouraging further\n        innovation from product developers, helping to save lives both across London\n        and more widely across the UK.",
     "TRL has now contacted more\n        than a dozen companies across the UK, inviting them to take part in the\n        evaluation and to become one of the first suppliers to be accredited using this\n        approach.",
     "Once completed, the research will be made available to download from\n        the TfL website and be used by the operators and manufacturers of HGVs and\n        suppliers of safety technology.",
     "Leon Daniels, Managing\n        Director of Surface Transport at TfL, said: \"Improving the safety of all road\n        users is vitally important and, with technology moving so quickly, it is\n        important that companies know that any safety equipment they invest in not only\n        offers value for money, but does what it says on the tin. By funding this\n        project, we can help companies make informed choices, encouraging use of the\n        best equipment available and helping to drive development into further\n        improvements in the future.\"",
     "The research project builds\n        on the continuing work that TfL is carrying out to make London's roads safer\n        for all.",
     "Recently, it was announced that trials of a range of innovative\n        radar-based technologies fitted to London Buses will be carried out this\n        summer.",
     "The Mayor of London, TfL and London Councils are also proposing a Safer\n        Lorry Scheme, which will require every vehicle in London over 3.5 tonnes to be\n        fitted with sideguards to protect cyclists from falling under the wheels.",
     "It\n        will also require vehicles to be fitted with mirrors giving the driver a better\n        view of cyclists and pedestrians around their vehicles.",

     "In October 2013, TfL and the Department for\n        Transport (DfT) formed the Industrial HGV Task Force (IHTF) which aims to\n        crackdown on non-compliant HGV operators and drivers.",
     "In the past six months\n        the partnership has worked successfully to target the most dangerous commercial\n        vehicles, helping to improve the safety of everyone using London's roads.",
     "This\n        intelligence led enforcement has seen over 1,960 vehicles targeted and stopped,\n        24 vehicles seized, 15 prosecutions progressed through the Criminal Justice\n        System and 519 fixed penalty notices issued for offences",
     "In June 2013, the Mayor and Transport for\n        London published Safe Streets for London: an ambitious and comprehensive plan\n        to reduce further the number of people killed or seriously injured in London by\n        40 per cent by 2020: \u003ca href=\"http://# http://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/safe-streets-for-london.pdf\"\u003ehttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/safe-streets-for-london.pdf\u003c/a\u003e ",
     "In February 2014 the Mayor and TfL published\n        six safety commitments, which supports the plan and brings focus to the range\n        of actions needed by us and our partners to make our streets safer: \u003ca href=\"http://#http://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/safe-london-streets-our-six-road-safety-commitments.pdf    \"\u003ehttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/safe-london-streets-our-six-road-safety-commitments.pdf\u003c/a\u003e ",

     "2.   \n        To prioritise safety of the most vulnerable\n        groups - pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists - which make up 80 per cent of\n        serious and fatal collision",
     "3.   \n        To provide substantial funding for road\n        safety, invested in the most effective and innovative schemes",
     "4.   \n        To increase efforts with the police and\n        enforcement agencies in tackling illegal, dangerous and careless road user\n        behaviour that puts people at risk",
     "5.   \n        To campaign for changes in national and EU\n        law to make roads, vehicles and drivers safer",
     "6.   \n        To work in partnership with boroughs and\n        London's road safety stakeholders to spread best practice and share data and\n        information"
