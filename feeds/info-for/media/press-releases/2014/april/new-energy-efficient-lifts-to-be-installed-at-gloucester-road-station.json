     "Customers using\n        Gloucester Road station are set to benefit from brand new lifts at the station\n        which will mean a quicker, more reliable service.",
     "The current lifts at Gloucester Road station were installed around 25 years ago\n        and work to replace them simultaneously will begin towards the end of\n        May.",
     "The new modern lifts are expected to be installed and operational by\n        December 2014.",
     "By replacing the lifts simultaneously, TfL will reduce the impact on customers\n        using the station as the total time to replace the lifts will be around 7\n        months rather than 13 months.",
     "The new lifts will also be more energy efficient\n        and contribute towards TfL's commitment to reduce its carbon footprint.",
     "While the lifts are replaced Piccadilly line trains won't stop at Gloucester\n        Road station.",
     "Circle and District line services will continue to serve\n        Gloucester Road as usual, with Piccadilly line services available from South\n        Kensington and Earl's Court, both of which provide an interchange with the\n        District line.",
     "Phil Hufton,\n        Chief Operating Officer for London Underground, said: \"The lift replacement\n        work at Gloucester Road is part of a vital programme of works to renew and\n        upgrade escalators and lifts across the network to make them fit for the future\n        and to improve reliability. We have\n        explored various options to carry out these works, while keeping disruption to\n        a minimum for our customers.  This included the option of replacing the\n        lifts one at a time to enable the Piccadilly line to stop at the station. Due to\n        our consideration for the safety of our customers it would have been difficult\n        to cope with the number of customers who use the Piccadilly line, with only one\n        lift in operation. We apologise\n        for the disruption to journeys this will cause in the short-term, but customers\n        will experience the benefits of a more reliable lift service in future.\"",
     "Replacing the lifts will require engineers to completely remove the existing\n        lift cars as well as replace all of the structural, mechanical and electrical\n        parts. Work to modify the steel structure work within the lift shaft is also\n        required, adding to the complexity of the work. \n         \n        Ancillary services, including fire safety systems and ventilation,\n        will also be overhauled as part of this work.",
     "The work is essential to provide for London's growing transport needs now, and\n        into the future",
     "TfL is urging all Londoners and Tube, London Overground, London\n        Tramlink and DLR customers to \"check before you travel\" at weekends, allowing\n        extra journey time where necessary.",
