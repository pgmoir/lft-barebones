     "Figures for Periods 9, 10 and 11 (10 November to 1 February) show that London Underground (LU) is on target to beat last year's record year for reliability, despite carrying more passengers than ever before, with a ten per cent fall in delays compared to the same periods last year.",
     "Across the three periods, LU carried 14.5m more customers than in the corresponding periods in 2012/13, with the week ending 14 December setting a new record outside the Olympic Games period with 27.3m journeys made.",
     "The level of services operated rose to over 98 per cent by Period 11, the 20th period in the last two years in which LU has exceeded service targets.",
     "Stations closures and track-related delays also fell during Period 11.",
     "Phil Hufton, Chief Operating Officer of London Underground, said:",
     "'The winter months, not least the stormy weather seen in December and January, present a lot of challenges to my team to maintain the high standards of reliability we've achieved.",
     "However, we have well-rehearsed plans which were put into action to keep services moving and which means we remain on track to meet our target of reducing 2011-level delays by 30 per cent by the end of 2015.'",
     "Across the network, delays to customers' journeys have been reduced by 42 per cent since 2008/09 and 59 per cent since 2003/04.",
     "The continuing trend of long-term improvement on the Tube follows the success of the London Underground Reliability Programme, introduced in 2011.",
     "London Underground continues to develop and implement more reliable solutions to meet the Mayor's commitment of reducing delays on the network.\u003cbr /\u003e",
