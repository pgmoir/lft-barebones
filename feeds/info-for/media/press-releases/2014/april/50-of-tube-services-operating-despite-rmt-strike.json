More London Underground staff have come to work this morning which has allowed us to run a much better service than during the last, equally pointless, strike.\"Fifty per cent of Tube services are running and two-thirds of stations are open.  We have a record number of buses operating and full or enhanced services on the London Overground, DLR, Tramlink and River.  Barclays Cycle hires are 70 per cent up.  Eighty seven per cent of the usual number of Oyster cards have been used on the TfL network this morning.'",
     "'Under our plans to modernise the Tube, fairness to our staff is guaranteed.  There will be no compulsory redundancies, there is a job for all staff wanting to remain with us and no one will lose pay.  We have made significant changes to our original proposals after listening to staff and unions in over 40 meetings, including agreeing that supervisors will not need to 'reapply for their jobs'.'",
     "'Only the RMT leadership know the real motivations behind their action, but it is infuriating that London's commuters and businesses are the ones who are being forced to pay the price with five days of unnecessary disruption.\"\"My message to the leadership of the RMT is that we will not be diverted from doing the right thing by our customers and staff. They should call the strike off and instead work with us to help shape the future of the Tube.'",
