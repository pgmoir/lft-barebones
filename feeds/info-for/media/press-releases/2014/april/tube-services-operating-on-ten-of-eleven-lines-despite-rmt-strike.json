     "London Underground (LU) is operating Tube services on ten of 11 lines, nearly all of which are serving crucial zone 1 stations.",
     "The exception is the Piccadilly Line where we have concentrated on a connection serving Heathrow Airport from Hammersmith.",
     "Three Tube lines, the Jubilee, Northern and Victoria are running the entire line.",
     "This morning services ran on all lines during peak morning travel All this despite the pointless strike called by the leadership of the RMT union.",
     "This service level is better than at this stage yesterday and is far higher than during the last strike in February.",
     "Around 80 per cent of stations (200+) are open and 90 per cent of Oyster cards that would normally be used on the TfL network were used yesterday, showing that London is working and open for business.",
     "Record numbers of buses are again operating. Barclays Cycle Hire journeys were up 73 per cent this morning compared to an average weekday morning.",
     "Yesterday, they were up by 50 per cent across the whole day.",
     "Many thousands of staff and volunteer Travel Ambassadors drawn from TfL's support functions will again be out in force working hard to help customers and road users make their journeys.",
     "The strikes have been called by the leadership of the RMT union over plans to modernise the Tube.",
     "Under these plans, at the busiest stations there will be nearly a third more staff visible and available to provide, on a permanent basis, the face-to-face customer service offered during the London 2012 Games.",
     "Visitors to London and people with disabilities will be better looked after than ever before.",
     "The modernisation will see savings of £50 million a year which will be reinvested in more frequent and reliable train services and will help keep fares down.",
     "Safety and security will never be compromised.",
     "Safety is not controlled from ticket offices but by station supervisors and dedicated control rooms.",
     "This will continue.Mike Brown, Managing Director of London Underground, said:",
     "'I'm sorry that Londoners are enduring more disruption today as a result of the RMT's pointless strike action. The only sensible course is for the RMT leadership to call off the strikes and get back to working with us to shape the future of the Tube, as the other three unions are doing.'",
     "'It was tough for our customers yesterday, but with more staff arriving for work than during the last strike in February, we were able to run fifty per cent of the train service and keep two-thirds of stations open. Things have already got better today, with nearly three-quarters of stations open. Nearly ninety per cent of the normal number of Oyster cards were used yesterday.  We are  working really hard to further improve this level of service.'",
     "'We again have a record number of buses operating and full or enhanced services on the London Overground, DLR and Tramlink.",
     "'Under our plans to modernise the Tube, we're committed to a safe railway with an increased number of visible staff - by 30 per cent at our busiest stations - personally serving our passengers.  That means more staff than ever on hand providing help for customers who need it most.'",
     "'Fairness to our staff is guaranteed. There will be no compulsory redundancies, there is a job for all staff wanting to remain with us and no one will lose pay.  We have made significant changes to our original proposals after listening to our people and the unions in over 40 meetings.'",
