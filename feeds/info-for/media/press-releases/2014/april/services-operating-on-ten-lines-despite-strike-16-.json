     "Two thirds of stations are open\nand almost 90 per cent of Oyster cards that would normally be used on the TfL\nnetwork have been used today, showing that London is working and open for\nbusiness.",

     "The\nstrikes have been called by the leadership of the RMT union over plans to\nmodernise the Tube.\nUnder\nthese plans, at the busiest stations there will be nearly a third more staff\nvisible and available to provide, on a permanent basis, the face-to-face\ncustomer service offered during the London 2012 Games.",

     "Mike\nBrown, Managing Director of London Underground, said:\n\"London\nhas continued to work and remain open for business in the face of this\npointless RMT strike, and I am grateful to our customers and staff for their\npatience today.  More London Underground staff have come to work this\nmorning which has allowed us to run more trains and operate more stations than\nlast time. Fifty\nper cent of Tube services are running and two-thirds of stations are open, with\nservices running on ten of our 11 lines.  We have a record number of buses\noperating and full or enhanced services on the London Overground, DLR, Tramlink\nand River.  Barclays Cycle hires are 50 per cent up over the whole day,\nand eighty seven per cent of the usual number of Oyster cards have been used on\nthe TfL network today.\nUnder\nour plans to modernise the Tube, we are committed to a safe railway with\nvisible staff personally serving our passengers.   Fairness to our\nstaff is guaranteed - there will be no compulsory redundancies, there is a job\nfor all staff wanting to remain with us and no one will lose pay.  We have\nmade significant changes to our original proposals after listening to our\npeople and the unions in over 40 meetings. The\nRMT leadership know the real motivations behind their action, but it is\ninfuriating that London's commuters and businesses are the ones who are being\nforced to pay the price with this unnecessary disruption.\"\n\"My\nmessage is clear; we will do the right thing for our customers and staff.\nThe RMT should call the strike off right now and work with us to help\nshape the future of the Tube.\"",
