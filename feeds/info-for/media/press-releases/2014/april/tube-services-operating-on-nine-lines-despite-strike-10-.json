     "London Underground (LU) is operating train services on nine lines despite the pointless strike called by the leadership of the RMT union. As planned, services will not run today on the Waterloo and City or Circle lines, the stations on which are served by other lines. Around 87 per cent of Oyster cards that would usually be see on the TfL network have been seen today - showing that London is working and open for business."

     "At the same time, the highest number of buses ever  are operating in London - 7,961, which is 266 more than usual. Barclays Cycle Hire journeys are up 60 per cent.",
     "Many thousands of staff and volunteer Travel Ambassadors drawn from TfL's support functions are out in force working hard to help customers and road users make their journeys.",
     "The strikes have been called by the leadership of the RMT union over plans to modernise the Tube.",
     "Under these plans, at the busiest stations there will be nearly a third more staff visible and available to provide, on a permanent basis, the face-to-face customer service offered during the London 2012 Games.",
     "Visitors to London and people with disabilities will be better looked after than ever before.",
     "The modernisation will see savings of Â£50 million a year which will be reinvested in more frequent and reliable train services and will help keep fares down.",
     "Safety and security will never be compromised.",
     "Safety is not controlled from ticket offices but by station supervisors and dedicated control rooms.",
     "This will  continue.Mike Brown, Managing Director of London Underground, said:",
     "'Thousands of staff and volunteers are working hard this morning to keep London working and our customers informed in the face of this pointless strike. More London Underground staff have come to work this morning than during the strike back in February, and a record number of London buses are operating.'",
     "'Under our plans, fairness to our staff is guaranteed.  There will be no compulsory redundancies, there is a job for all staff wanting to remain with us and no one will lose pay.  We have made significant changes to our original proposals after listening to staff and unions in over 40 meetings, including agreeing that supervisors will not need to 'reapply for their jobs'.'",
     "'Only the RMT leadership know the real motivations behind their action, but it is infuriating that London's commuters and businesses are the ones who are being forced to pay the price with five days of disruption.'",
     "'My message to the leadership of the RMT is that we will not be diverted from doing the right thing by our customers and staff. They should call the strike off and instead work with us to help shape the future of the Tube.'",
