     "'With more staff arriving for work than yesterday, we have been able to run 52 per cent of the train service and keep around 80 per cent of stations open.  We have carried 56 per cent of our normal passengers this morning and nearly ninety per cent of the normal number of Oyster cards have been used across the TfL public transport network.'",
     "'We again have a record number of buses operating and full or enhanced services on the London Overground, DLR and Tramlink.",
     "'Under our plans to modernise the Tube, we're committed to a safe railway with an increased number of visible staff - by 30 per cent at our busiest stations - personally serving our passengers.  That means more staff than ever on hand providing help for customers who need it most.'",
     "'Fairness to our staff is guaranteed. There will be no compulsory redundancies, there is a job for all staff wanting to remain with us and no one will lose pay.  We have made significant changes to our original proposals after listening to our people and the unions in over 40 meetings.'",
