Until the new rolling stock arrives,  TfL will set about refreshing the existing West Anglia train fleet, including deep cleaning and rebranding to provide a cleaner, brighter environment for customers.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn addition, TfL will ensure all 24 stations (there are 26 on the new routes including the Romford to Upminster line) for which it will take responsibility are upgraded with a deep clean, new signage, improved CCTV and passenger information systems.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe Gospel Oak to Barking route, which is already part of London Overground, is being electrified by Network Rail and due to be completed in 2017.",
