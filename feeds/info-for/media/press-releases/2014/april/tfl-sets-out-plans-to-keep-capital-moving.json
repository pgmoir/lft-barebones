The whole Tube station will effectively become a personalised customer service centre, with more staff visible and available to help customers buy the right ticket, plan their journeys Over the past eight weeks, we have met with our trades unions colleagues on more than 40 separate occasions.  We have listened to their concerns and made changes as a result.  We've provided guarantees that not a single member of staff will be forced to leave LU, that no supervisors must 'apply for their own job' and we are seeking ways to ensure that no member of staff sees their pay cut as a result of these changes.Given these commitments and guarantees, Londoners will rightly be asking why the RMT is threatening five days of strikes?  All it will achieve is disruption to Londoners and a loss of pay for all those staff who take part.  My message to the RMT leadership is its not too late to call off this unnecessary strike and continue to work with us to help shape the future of the Tube.  However, should it go ahead we will be working harder than ever to keep London moving and open for business\".",
