     "As it embarks on an unprecedented programme of improvement to\n        cycling infrastructure, Transport for London (TfL) has outlined a range of\n        innovative trials and initiatives, which will begin later this year as part of\n        the continuing work to make the capital's roads safer for everyone.",
     "The\n        work, which will include making bicycles more easily visible and vehicle\n        braking systems more responsive, forms part of TfL's revised Cycle Safety\n        Action Plan which was published for public comment today.",
     "The fully updated London Cycling Design Standards, which inform\n        the work of those designing cycling infrastructure in the capital, have also\n        been published for public consultation today to help further transform London's\n        streets with world leading cycling provision.",
     "One of TfL's top priorities is to reduce by 40 per cent the number\n        of people killed or seriously injured on London's roads by 2020. Recently, the\n        Mayor and TfL published six commitments that are guiding initiatives to deliver\n        this, and action is being taken to prioritise the safety of the most vulnerable\n        road users:  pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists.",
     "The revised Cycle Safety Action Plan builds on the previous plan\n        published in 2010, and contains 32 new actions which TfL, the police, London\n        boroughs and all organisations involved in making cycling safer will work\n        together to deliver between now and 2020.  New actions within the Plan\n        include:\n         \n        ·",
     "Helping to reduce HGV traffic\n        during peak hours by trialling innovative quiet vehicle technology to help expand\n        off-peak delivery. This would remove conflicts between cyclists and lorries\n        during morning and evening rush hours",
     "Working with manufacturers to\n        develop better designs for side guards in order to further prevent fatal and\n        serious injuries, as well as delivering the Safer Lorry Scheme this year",
     "Carrying out trials of detection\n        equipment on London buses to help drivers be more aware of pedestrians and\n        cyclists near their vehicles, which if successful could be rolled out across\n        London's bus fleet. TfL will also look to trial Intelligent Speed Adaptation\n        (ISA), which would monitor and potentially restrict the top speed of buses",
     "Working with the automotive\n        industry to explore how improvements to car design could further protect\n        cyclists, such as Autonomous Emergency Braking Systems, which could help make\n        vehicles stop more quickly, and the introduction of a EuroNCAP safety rating\n        system for cyclists so that car buyers can assess the cycle safety credentials\n        of any new vehicle",
     "Working with cycle manufacturers\n        to improve how easy it is to see bicycles by building lights or\n        retro-reflective equipment into bike frames",
     "Continuing to develop and deliver\n        the Safer Urban Driving CPC course to help put more than 10,000 freight and\n        fleet drivers a year through essential safety training",
     "Doubling the number of adult\n        cyclists receiving advanced skills training by creating a dedicated London\n        Virtual Skills Hub. This will allow online booking of cycle training and\n        advanced safety skills across London to attract more commuter cyclists to take\n        up training.",
     "The London Cycling Design Standards have also been comprehensively\n        updated to highlight best practice, as well as the lessons from TfL's recent\n        trials of innovative measures such as methods of segregation and low-level cycle\n        signals. The new design standards reflect the Mayor's Roads Task Force\n        'street-types' approach, and are geared towards helping planners and designers\n        deliver the ambitions of the Mayor's Vision for Cycling.",
     "Andrew Gilligan, The Mayors Cycling Commissioner said: \"The Mayor\n        is spending hundreds of millions of pounds on better bike infrastructure to\n        cater for the vast growth in cycling on London's roads. This document aims to\n        see that those projects are delivered to higher standards. We do not expect perfection,\n        and the best must not be the enemy of the good. But as the Mayor has said,\n        everything we pay for must be done at least adequately, or not at all.\n         \n        \"At the same time, we know that TfL and City Hall have no monopoly\n        of wisdom. The standards will be consulted on before they become final by the\n        end of the year. We welcome ideas, and we know that many of the ideas which\n        people liked most in the cycle vision were pioneered in the London boroughs.\"",
     "Leon Daniels, Managing Director of Surface Transport at TfL said:\n        \"Cycling in London is now commonplace on our roads with around 600,000 cycle\n        journeys taking place every day across the capital, the equivalent to almost\n        ten per cent of daily bus journeys and about a fifth of trips made by tube\n        passengers. These proposed revisions to the London Cycling Design Standards, as\n        well as the revised Cycle Safety Action Plan, will help us further encourage\n        more to take to two wheels, while ensuring that they can do so in the safest\n        and most direct way possible.\"",
     "TfL is also formally responding to the Department for Transport\n        (DfT)'s consultation on changes to the national regulations governing roadsigns\n        and markings. The proposed new document by the DfT includes a number of changes\n        which have been heavily lobbied for by the Mayor and TfL during 2013, including\n        the ability to install low level, cycle-specific traffic lights; improvements\n        to pedestrian and cyclist crossings and relaxation of requirements for traffic\n        regulation orders for many cycle friendly facilities such as mandatory cycle\n        lanes. To support these steps, the London Cycling Design Standards includes the\n        regulatory innovations proposed by DfT.",
