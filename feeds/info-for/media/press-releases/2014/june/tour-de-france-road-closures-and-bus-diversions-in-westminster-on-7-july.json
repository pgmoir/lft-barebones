     "With less than a month to go until the world's largest annual\n        sporting event comes to the City of Westminster, Transport for London (TfL) is\n        holding a local information session to keep Londoners informed about the event.",
     "The iconic Tour de France will roll onto the streets of London on\n        Monday 7 July bringing out hundreds of thousands of Londoners and visitors to\n        see this spectacle.",
     "On\n        the day, a large number of road closures around the route will be in place so\n        people are advised to  plan their  travel in advance. Road closures for the event will begin after the morning peak at\n        10:00, with roads reopening as quickly as possible once the Tour has passed\n        through and it is safe to do so. TfL anticipates that all roads will be\n        reopened by 18:00. Pedestrians will be able to cross the route at key crossing\n        points and we are working with local businesses close to the route to ensure\n        that disruption is kept to a minimum.",

     "Tower, Southwark and Westminster Bridges will be closed for much\n        of the day but there are no planned closures on any other major river crossings\n        in central London.",
     "An\n        extensive programme of public engagement and communication around the\n        arrival of the Tour de France in the capital is now underway similar to that\n        developed during the London 2012 Olympics, to help businesses and the public plan and get\n        around on the day and make the most of the return of the prestigious event.",
     "Residents of the City of Westminster are invited to attend a\n        public information session at Westminster City Hall on Wednesday 25 June\n        between 16:00 and 19:00 which will allow members of the community to talk\n        through the event and its impact on the local area with representatives from TfL.",
     "The\n        City of Westminster will be well and truly open for business, and people are\n        encouraged to enjoy the atmosphere on their own roads that the riders and the\n        publicity caravanne will create.",
     "The\n        city will be a great place to see the world's best riders as they pass iconic\n        London landmarks such as Trafalgar Square, the Houses of Parliament, St James's\n        Park and ending up with the final stretch down the Mall.",
     "The Tour de\n        France - the world's largest annual sporting event - comes to London on Monday\n        7 July after the first two stages in Yorkshire. Around 200 elite cyclists will\n        travel from Cambridge, through Essex, into London before a spectacular finish\n        on The Mall.",
     "The Tour de\n        France will draw people onto the streets of London from near and far, and help\n        to inspire more people to take up cycling. Hosting world renowned events such\n        as the Tour reinforces London's reputation as a world-class host of cultural,\n        sporting and business events. Visitors, both domestic and overseas, are brought\n        to the capital by major events, delivering direct and indirect economic\n        benefits, and showcasing London to a much wider audience.",
     "Garrett Emmerson,\n        Chief Operating Officer for Surface Transport at TfL, said: \"We've been working long and hard to\n        plan for the return of the Tour to the capital and now we are asking Londoners\n        to start their planning too.\n         \n        \"We will keep the capital moving, and roads around the race\n        route will, of course, be extremely busy.  So we're asking people to plan\n        ahead and preferably use public transport to make the most of what I'm sure\n        will be an amazing day, helping to \n        cement London's growing reputation as a major cycling city and encourage\n        more Londoners to travel by bike.\"",
     "Bus\n        services around the route will be affected. Some bus services to and from Westminster\n        will need to be diverted, temporarily suspended or terminate earlier than their\n        usual destination, as a result of road closures. Affected local routes include:\n        3, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 23, 24, 29, 53, 87, 88, 91, 139, 148, 159, 176, 211\n        and 453.",
     "Some\n        stops will also be temporarily relocated or suspended. Routes 14, 19, 22, 38\n        and 94 are not affected.",
