     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Changes proposed to Crossrail 2 route following feedback from consultation last year\"]}",
     "Transport for London (TfL) and Network Rail have today launched a second consultation on Crossrail 2 which will look at variations to the proposed route.",
     "Crossrail 2 would create a new high frequency, high capacity rail line with shorter journey times between south west and north east London.",
     "Its route is designed to address capacity constraints in the south west as well as providing vital new connections across the capital which will help to support economic growth, providing opportunities for thousands of new jobs and homes.",
     "The results of an earlier consultation on Crossrail 2 carried out last year by TfL and Network Rail demonstrated considerable support for Crossrail 2, particularly for the Regional route.",
     "This route, which will travel through London and into Surrey and Hertfordshire, will provide greater benefits through journey and congestion relief across the existing rail network.",
     "It will also create much needed additional capacity on the main line network and have a greater impact on regeneration and development particularly in outer London and the Upper Lea Valley.",
     "However it also raised some issues on specific route alignments.",
     "This second consultation will explore these specific aspects in more depth.",
     "Work carried out to review the comments and proposed changes by the public consultation in 2013 identified some potential changes to the route which may offer further passenger benefits, better value for money and potentially better opportunities for local growth and regeneration to increase the supply of housing and jobs.",
     "As a result a further consultation being launched today will look specifically at:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Alternative route alignments in the London borough of Hackney;\",\"Extending the terminal destination for Crossrail 2 from Alexandra Palace to New Southgate; and\",\"Alternative locations for the proposed station in Chelsea.\"]}",
     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said:",
     "'If London and its economy are to keep moving then it's essential that we crack on and get Crossrail 2 delivered. It's a vital project not just for the capital, but also for the regions from which hordes of commuters struggle into work on packed carriages each day. As we've seen with Crossrail 1, major transport projects like this have an enormous role to play not just in boosting capacity, but in galvanising economic development and unlocking the potential for jobs and homes. We know there's huge appetite from passengers and from business to get this project off the ground and as we take the hugely important step in fine-tuning the potential route we're genuinely keen to hear people's views.'",
     "TfL's Managing Director of Planning, Mich√®le Dix, said:",
     "'People can clearly see the immense value of Crossrail 2 which will create a new high frequency, high capacity rail line with shorter journey times between southwest and northeast London and relieve pressure on suburban rail routes and the Underground as well as helping to spur economic growth in and beyond the capital. Crossrail 2 is a vital addition to London's transport system and as we move forward with this second consultation we're another step closer to making it a reality.'",
     "Network Rail's Group Strategy Director, Paul Plummer, said:",
     "'London's railways are already the busiest and most congested in the country, with many main lines operating at, or close to, capacity. Working jointly with TfL we must press on with schemes such as Crossrail 2 so that public transport continues to support and drive economic growth.'",
     "The consultation will run for six weeks, from 9 June to 25 July 2014.",
     "More information can be found at \u003ca href=\"http://www.crossrail2.co.uk\"\u003ewww.crossrail2.co.uk\u003c/a\u003e .",
     "Local drop-in\n        sessions for people to find out more about the options will be held in\n        Chelsea, Hackney and Dalston from mid June, further details and dates of\n        the events are available on the website.",
     "Even with the Tube upgrade\n        works and the delivery of Crossrail 1, Crossrail 2 is needed to provided\n        additional capacity on the transport network so that it is able to cope\n        with London's forecasted population growth, expected to reach 10\n        million by 2030.",
     "The results of this second consultation will inform a\n        revision to the project safeguarding later in the year.",
     "More detailed\n        design will then be needed and an application for Powers to build could\n        take place in 2018.",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Last year's consultation received around 14,000 responses with 96 per cent supporting or strongly supporting the principle of Crossrail 2.\",\"Eighty-four per cent supported or strongly supported the Regional option (compared to 73 per cent for the Metro option).\",\"The benefits of the Regional option could reach people in Hertfordshire, Surrey and beyond by enabling more trains to run on busy National Rail routes.
