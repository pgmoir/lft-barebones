     "Bus passengers travelling between Epson and Kingston will have a more regular bus service from Saturday (28 June) as Transport for London (TfL) increases capacity on both routes 406 and 418.",
     "This service improvement will see the route 406, which runs via Ewell, and the route 418, which runs via Ruxley Lane, increase their Monday to Saturday daytime frequency by 50 per cent with a bus every 20 minutes instead of the current 30 minute service.",
     "This will provide passengers travelling between Epsom and Kingston and on the sections where both routes run in parallel with a combined service of a bus every 10 minutes.",
     "There is no change to the frequency during the evenings and on Sundays.",
     "John Barry, TfL's Head of Network Development for buses, said:",
     "'We regularly review the network and have seen a considerable increase in passenger numbers using routes 406 and 418. This more frequent service will help meet the growing passenger demand.'",
     "This service change is part of TfL's management and development of a network that comprises of around 700 routes across Greater London operated by 7,600 buses at peak times, carrying more than 2.4 billion passengers every year.",
     "TfL keeps the network under regular review, working with the London boroughs and other partners to help ensure that services can respond to London's changing travel needs.",
