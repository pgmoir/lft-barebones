     "The most modern buses -\n        including those powered by hydrogen, electricity and hybrid technology - will\n        be stationed near Oxford Circus, with vehicles increasing in age as visitors\n        make their way towards Piccadilly Circus.  Buses on display from a bygone\n        era will include an example of the earliest horse-drawn bus, motor buses -\n        including London Transport Museum's recently restored B-type bus, a trolley bus\n        and the original and iconic Routemaster.",
     "Visitors\n        to the Regent Street Bus Cavalcade will also get the chance to",
     "Visit a bus shelter and bus stop made\n        entirely out of Lego outside Hamleys toy shop.  Lego will also be holding\n        workshops for children throughout the day where\n        they can make Lego bus stops to take home",

     "Visit the Battle Bus exhibition and find out\n        about London Transport Museum's newly restored B-type bus which will be on\n        display at the event. These buses were commandeered in large numbers during the\n        First World War and converted into 'Battle Buses' to carry soldiers to the\n        frontline and were also used as ambulances and even mobile pigeon lofts",
     "Visit the London-based contemporary jewellery\n        company Tatty Devine's stall which is launching a bus-inspired jewellery range\n        created especially for the Year of the Bus. Tatty Devine will also hold\n        jewellery making workshops on board a London bus",

     "Leon Daniels, TfL's Managing\n        Director of Surface Transport, said: \"I'm delighted that Regent Street will\n        play host to fifty buses from across almost two centuries in what will be a\n        hugely memorable tribute to the humble London bus.  The cavalcade will\n        give Londoners and visitors to the city a unique chance to clamber aboard an\n        exciting array of vehicles from the 1820s to the present day with lots of other\n        free activities on offer to keep the whole family entertained. Buses have\n        always been a key part of transport in London and this flagship Year of the Bus\n        event will ensure that London buses, the bus drivers and the staff who support\n        them get their richly deserved moment in the spotlight.\"",
     "David Shaw, Head of the\n        Regent Street Portfolio at The Crown Estate, said: \"Over 90 per cent of those\n        who come to Regent Street arrive by the great public transport delivered by\n        TfL. We have partnered successfully with TfL on the Oxford Circus diagonals and\n        the Piccadilly two way scheme. The Regent Street Bus Cavalcade is an important\n        part of the Regent Street event programme and will be great fun.\"",
     "Events and activities are\n        being held throughout 2014 to celebrate the role that London buses play in\n        keeping the capital moving, and mark a number of important anniversaries. \n        These include 60 years since the creation of the original and iconic\n        Routemaster, 75 years since the launch of its predecessor the RT-type bus, and\n        100 years since hundreds of London buses were sent to the Western Front to play\n        a crucial role during the First World War.",
     "Buses are a vital daily\n        service for millions and one that is very local, with the vast majority of\n        Londoners (95 per cent) never more than 400 metres from a bus stop.  Buses\n        link homes to jobs, schools and hospitals in every part of the capital. \n        They are the backbone, and often the forgotten workhorses, of London's\n        transport network.",
