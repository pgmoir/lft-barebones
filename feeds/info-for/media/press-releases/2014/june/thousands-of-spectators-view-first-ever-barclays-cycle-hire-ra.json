     "Ryan Carus from Wimbledon was\n        crowned the winner of the thrilling first ever Barclays Cycle Hire race as part\n        of the Jupiter London Nocturne.",
     "Thirty riders, including UK\n        boy-band Rough Copy, former Olympian Jeanette Kwakye, rapper Mikill Pane, radio\n        presenter Jade Avia, TV presenter Andy Samuels and competition winners from\n        across the capital, peddled their way around the 1.5km course in an exciting\n        race on Saturday evening.",
     "The five lap Barclays Cycle Hire race was carried out\n        on iconic blue bikes and special edition yellow cycle hire bikes released to\n        celebrate the Tour de France coming to London.",
     "Speaking after winning the race,\n        Ryan Carus, said: \"Thanks to\n        TfL, Barclays Cycle Hire and the Jupiter London Nocturne for the race\n        yesterday.",
     "The atmosphere was completely surreal and it was such an incredible\n        event. I'm currently training with my club, the Kingston Wheelers, for my next\n        challenge - the Prudential RideLondon 100.\"",
     "TfL's General Manager for Barclays\n        Cycle Hire, Nick Aldworth, said: \"From the first corner to the exciting final\n        lap, the Barclays Cycle Hire race on Saturday night was thrilling from start to\n        finish. Although Ryan Carus was a worthy winner, all 30 competitors deserve\n        praise for providing such a pulse-racing event!\"\n         \n        \"The Jupiter London Nocturne was\n        just the first of a host of fantastic cycling events taking place across the\n        capital this summer, including the return of the Tour de France and Prudential\n        RideLondon, helping to cement London's reputation as a true cycling city.\"",
     "FACE Partnership MD and organiser,\n        James Pope, said: \"The Barclays Cycle Hire Race at the Jupiter London Nocturne\n        created a huge buzz and it was a fantastic addition to our race programme.\n        Added to the folding bikes, Penny Farthings, track bikes and retro bikes racing\n        around Smithfield Market, it all made a great spectacle for the fans.\"",
     "The Jupiter London Nocturne took\n        place exactly one month before the Tour de France - the world's largest annual\n        sporting event - returns to London on Monday 7 July. After two stages in\n        Yorkshire, around 200 elite cyclists will travel from Cambridge, through Essex,\n        into London before a spectacular finish on The Mall. The Tour de France will\n        draw people onto the streets of London from near and far, and help to inspire\n        more people to take up cycling in the capital.",
     "The Tour de France is followed by\n        two more exciting cycling events in London - Prudential RideLondon on 9 and 10\n        August and the Tour of Britain, which takes place between 7 and 14 September\n        and traditionally finishes in the capital.",
     "This summer's cycling events are\n        likely to inspire thousands more Londoners to take to two wheels, building on\n        the Mayor's ambition for cycling to be an integral part of the transport\n        network  As part of his cycling vision, the Mayor is already engaging in a vast\n        £1billion programme of improvements - creating a series of major new segregated\n        cycle routes, enhanced cycling superhighways, urban quietways and turning some\n        outer boroughs into mini-Hollands.",
     "There are currently over 10,000\n        Barclays Cycle Hire bikes across London with over 19,000 docking points\n        available. The scheme, which is already the second largest cycle hire system in\n        Europe, last month celebrated 30 million journeys since its launch and remains\n        an affordable and enjoyable way to travel around London.",
     "A Barclays Cycle Hire membership\n        key costs just £3 with membership costs at £2 for a 24-hour access period.  The\n        first 30 minutes of every journey is free. Around 93 per cent of all journeys\n        made by Barclays Cycle Hire members have been under 30 minutes, which means\n        that the vast majority of people using the scheme aren't paying any more than\n        their access fees.",
