     "John Barry, TfL's Head of Network\n        Development for buses, said: \"We regularly review the network and have seen a\n        considerable increase in passenger numbers using the route W19.  This more\n        frequent service will help meet the growing passenger demand.\"",
     "This service change is part\n        of TfL's management and development of a network that comprises of around 700\n        routes across Greater London operated by 7,600 buses at peak times, carrying\n        more than 2.4 billion passengers every year.  TfL keeps the network under\n        regular review, working with the London boroughs and other partners to help\n        ensure that services can respond to London's changing travel needs.",
