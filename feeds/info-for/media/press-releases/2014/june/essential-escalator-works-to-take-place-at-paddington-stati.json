     "Essential\n        escalator maintenance will take place at Paddington station between 29 June and\n        22 August as engineers remove and replace hundreds of mechanical and electrical\n        parts to ensure that the escalators continue to run reliably.",
     "Escalators on\n        the Underground are longer and more heavy duty than most. They carry huge\n        volumes of people and run for approximately 20 hours a day.",
     "The two\n        escalators at Paddington station that lead down to the Bakerloo line platforms\n        are used by 88,000 people a day and now need an extended period of work in\n        order to continue working effectively.  Not doing the works at this time\n        could mean the escalators failing in service, which would cause significant\n        disruption for customers.",
     "The work\n        involves replacing major components, overhauling every step on both escalators\n        and replacing worn equipment.",
     "The planned works will be done one escalator at a\n        time to enable the other escalator to run in the up position, allowing\n        customers to exit the Bakerloo line from the station.\n         \n        While the\n        escalator work is taking place the Bakerloo line will be \"exit only\", with all\n        other lines operating a normal service.",
     "Customers are advised to use\n        alternative lines from Paddington, such as the Circle and Hammersmith \u0026\n        City lines to Baker Street to connect with the Bakerloo line.",
     "Alternatively\n        Edgware Road (Bakerloo) station is within walking distance of Paddington.",
     "The work is part\n        of the continuing Tube investment programme with major stations, trains, track\n        and signalling being modernised or replaced to provide more capacity for a\n        growing city and better journeys for customers. A huge range of improvements\n        are being made at Paddington, including the creation of a Crossrail station,\n        which will add a 24 train an hour peak service that connects Paddington with\n        Heathrow, the West End, the City and Canary Wharf.",
     "On the Underground, new\n        lifts have been installed from a new ticket hall to the Circle and Hammersmith\n        \u0026 City line platforms, and a new entrance with a spacious new station\n        concourse has been added from the Paddington Basin side of the station, along\n        with improved CCTV and other features throughout.",
     "Phil Hufton,\n        LU's Chief Operating Officer, said: \"Paddington is benefitting from huge\n        investment as we modernise the Underground station, replace outdated equipment\n        and prepare for Crossrail. The escalator work is vital to ensure their\n        continued safe and reliable operation, we're doing everything possible to\n        minimise the disruption and to provide customers with the information they need\n        to make their journeys in slightly different ways whilst the work is carried\n        out.\"",
