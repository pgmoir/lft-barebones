     "High voltage electrical\n        systems on the London Underground (LU) network are set to be modernised over\n        the next eight years, with £250 million of investment that will enable LU to\n        run more services for customers more smoothly and reliably.",
     "A total of 17 suppliers have\n        now been selected for two eight-year power upgrade 'frameworks' that run\n        concurrently for the design, installation and commissioning of power networks.",
     "Modern power systems will help support the extra services that are being\n        introduced to meet rapidly growing passenger demand.\n        LU is in the process of finalising\n        the completion of the power upgrade needed for the Sub-Surface Railway upgrade,\n        which comprises the modernisation of the Metropolitan, District, Hammersmith\n        \u0026 City and Circle lines - around 40 per cent of the network. Planning is\n        now under way to upgrade power supply systems on the Piccadilly line and other\n        parts of the network.",
     "David Hughes, Director of\n        Major Programmes Sponsorship for LU, said: \"We've embarked on the biggest\n        programme of Tube modernisation ever seen. To do that we need to work with\n        suppliers who can bring experience and flexibility to the task in hand, and who\n        understand our vision to improve services for customers while providing a\n        reliable service with as little disruption as possible.\"",
     "The 17 companies engaged\n        across the two frameworks are:",

     "he service improvements are\n        part of the continuing modernisation of the Underground, with major stations,\n        trains, track and signalling being modernised or replaced to provide more\n        capacity for a growing city. LU's plans to improve customer service will also\n        see the public areas of stations - ticket halls, ticket gates and platforms -\n        become personalised customer service centres, replicating the standards of\n        service offered during the London 2012 Games.",
