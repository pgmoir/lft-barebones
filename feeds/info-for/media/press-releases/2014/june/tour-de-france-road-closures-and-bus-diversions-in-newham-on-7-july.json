     "The iconic Tour de France will roll onto the streets of London on Monday 7 July\n        bringing out hundreds of thousands of Londoners and visitors to see this\n        spectacle.",
     "On\n        the day, a large number of road closures around the route will be in place so\n        people are advised to plan their travel in advance. Road closures for the event will begin after the morning peak at\n        10:00, with roads reopening as quickly as possible once the Tour has passed\n        through and it is safe to do so.",
     "TfL anticipates that all roads will be\n        reopened by 18:00. Pedestrians will be able to cross the route at key crossing\n        points and we are working with local businesses close to the route to ensure\n        that disruption is kept to a minimum.",
     "Tower, Southwark and Westminster\n        Bridges will be closed for much of the\n        day but there are no planned closures on any other major river crossings in\n        central London.",
     "An\n        extensive programme of public engagement and communication around the\n        arrival of the Tour de France in the capital is now underway similar to that\n        developed during the London 2012 Olympics, to help businesses and the public plan and get\n        around on the day and make the most of the return of the prestigious event.",

     "The borough will be a great\n        place to see the world's best riders as they grace the site of Team GB's 2012\n        triumph, Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park (QEOP) where spectators will be able to\n        catch the action at a TfL spectator hub.

     "The Tour de\n        France - the world's largest annual sporting event - comes to London on Monday\n        7 July after the first two stages in Yorkshire. Around 200 elite cyclists will\n        travel from Cambridge, through Essex, into London, into QEOP before a spectacular\n        finish on The Mall.",
     "The Tour de\n        France will draw people onto the streets of London from near and far, and help\n        to inspire more people to take up cycling. Hosting world renowned events such\n        as the Tour reinforces London's reputation as a world-class host of cultural,\n        sporting and business events. Visitors, both domestic and overseas, are brought\n        to the capital by major events, delivering direct and indirect economic\n        benefits, and showcasing London to a much wider audience.",
     "Garrett\n        Emmerson, Chief Operating Officer for Surface Transport at TfL, said: \"We've\n        been working long and hard to plan for the return of the Tour to the capital\n        and now we are asking Londoners to start their planning too.\n         \n        \"We will keep the capital moving, and roads around the race\n        route will, of course, be extremely busy.  So we're asking people to plan\n        ahead and preferably use public transport to make the most of what I'm sure\n        will be an amazing day, helping to cement London's growing reputation as a\n        major cycling city and encourage more Londoners to travel by bike.\"",
