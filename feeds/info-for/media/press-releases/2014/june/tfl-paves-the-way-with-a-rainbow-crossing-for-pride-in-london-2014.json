     "London is set to see its\n        first ever rainbow zebra crossing as part of Transport for London's (TfL's)\n        support for the Pride in London event on Saturday 28 June.",
     "The rainbow crossing,\n        similar to ones that have appeared in Tel Aviv and Sydney, will be in place for\n        one day only during the parade at the junction of Pall Mall East and Suffolk\n        Street, on the site of an existing pedestrian crossing.",
     "The parade will be\n        passing very close to the colourful crossing, which will provide onlookers with\n        a great photo opportunity.",
     "Leon Daniels, Managing\n        Director of Surface Transport at TfL, said: \"We're delighted that for this\n        year's Pride in London event, we will be installing the first ever rainbow\n        zebra crossing in London to celebrate the event, and as we continue our Year of\n        the Bus celebrations, it's only fitting that we continue with the tradition of\n        our iconic open top bus transporting our staff around in the parade.\"",
     "Pride in London, one the\n        largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, \u0026 transgender (LGBT) events in the world,\n        is funded by the Mayor of London and this year will see TfL's iconic open-top\n        bus at the head of the parade. TfL's LGBT+ Network has also commissioned 200\n        limited edition posters in conjunction with London Transport Museum, which will\n        go on sale in the run up to Pride to celebrate Year of the Bus, and 75\n        Barclay's Cycle Hire bikes will carry a special 'Ride with Pride' logo during\n        Pride week.",
     "Martyn Loukes, Chair of\n        TfL's LGBT+ Network, said: \"I promised last year that I would make this happen,\n        and I'm really pleased that for one day, people will be able to compose their\n        very own Beatles photo or selfie on our Rainbow Crossing. They'll also be able\n        to ride with pride on one of our specially adorned Barclays Cycle Hire bikes.\n        Every year London Pride gets bigger and better and this shows real support from\n        so many organisations to make this crossing happen and is a fantastic thing for\n        the LGBT+ Community.\"",
     "The crossing was made\n        possible after an initial approach by Mike Freer MP, who first suggested the\n        idea in 2012. Since then TfL's LGBT+ Network has worked with Westminster\n        council, The Metropolitan Police, Underbelly, London LGBT+ Community Pride and\n        sub-contractors Applied Outdoor Media to make the crossing a reality.",
     "Mike Freer, Conservative MP\n        for Finchley and Golders Green, said: \"I am delighted that London will have its\n        own 'rainbow crossing' to celebrate London Pride. London is one of the most\n        diverse cities in the world and in the year that Same Sex Marriage became\n        legal, it is a wonderful symbol of London's vibrant LGBT community.\"",
     "Around\n        100 TfL staff, their partners, family and friends will be taking part in this\n        year's event and will be on the second bus at the head of the parade.",
