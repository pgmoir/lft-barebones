     "Transport\n        for London (TfL) has yet again successfully defended the rights of all of\n        London's road users from unsafe working and unnecessary delays and disruption\n        caused by utility companies.",
     "On\n        21 May 2014, Westminster Magistrate's Court fined Virgin Media and its contractor\n        McNicholas over £6,500 following a guilty plea to three offences on Chertsey\n        Road in the London Borough of Richmond.",
     "The seriousness of the offences led the\n        court to issue the maximum possible fines. As well as the maximum fine, Virgin\n        Media and McNicholas were made to pay the legal costs of £5,040, bringing the\n        total to £11,705.",
     "Virgin\n        Media pleaded guilty to two offences committed on Chertsey Road, Twickenham in\n        February 2014.",
     "These included carrying out unsafe working practices and\n        breaching permit conditions, namely excavating the entire width of Chertsey\n        Road. Virgin Media's contractor, McNicholas, also pleaded guilty to a breach of\n        permit conditions.",
     "In passing sentence the judge stated she was \"…horrified by\n        the sloppiness of the works, and the danger and severe disruption that they\n        caused'.",
     "It\n        is the latest in a series of successful prosecutions by TfL as it works to\n        reduce unnecessary roadworks to improve traffic flow and conditions for all\n        London's road users.",
     "Earlier this month, TfL successfully prosecuted Virgin\n        Media for five offences on Croydon Road in the London Borough of Sutton,\n        including unsafe working practices and permit breaches.",
     "Leon\n        Daniels, Managing Director of Surface Transport at TfL, said: \"In a frustrating\n        case of déjà vu, this is the second successful prosecution of Virgin Media in\n        as many months.\n          Utility\n        companies must ensure that any disruption caused by roadworks is minimised and\n        the most stringent safety is upheld. As we have demonstrated time and time\n        again, we will prosecute those who flout this.\"",
     "The\n        prosecution of Virgin Media is one of a number of ways TfL is improving\n        conditions for all of London's road users.",
     "As of April 2013, firms undertaking\n        work anywhere in London have to apply for a permit before they can begin\n        digging up the roads thanks to the London Permit Scheme.",
     "London's\n        Lane Rental Scheme, launched by the Mayor of London and TfL on 11 June 2012,\n        reduces road users delays by encouraging utility companies to avoid digging up\n        the busiest roads at peak traffic times.",
     "Since then, there has been over a 50\n        per cent reduction in peak-time utility roadworks at traffic hotspots.",
     "TfL\n        is leading the way for works promoters, including utility companies, by\n        avoiding incurring Lane Rental charges on 99 per cent of its works undertaken\n        in Lane Rental locations.",
     "Last\n        year, TfL successfully prosecuted Thames Water for nine road works offences and\n        Cable \u0026 Wireless for one offence of working in breach of permit conditions\n        and causing significant road disruption as a result.",
