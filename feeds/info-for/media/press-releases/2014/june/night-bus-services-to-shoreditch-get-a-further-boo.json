     "Local night bus services in the Shoreditch area are to get a further boost from this Friday (27 June), as Transport for London (TfL) increases the frequency of the N205 to provide extra capacity at weekends to meet increased passenger demand in this busy area.",
     "The route, which operates between Paddington and Leyton via King's Cross and Liverpool Street stations, will see weekend night bus capacity increase by 50 per cent.",
     "This will mean that on Friday night/Saturday morning and Saturday night/Sunday mornings a service will operate every 20 minutes instead of the current 30 minute service.",
     "This follows a service improvement last weekend that saw the weekend night bus service on route N26 increase to a bus every 12 minutes from a 20 minute service.",
     "John Barry, TfL's Head of Network Development for buses, said:",
     "'Demand for bus services in the Shoreditch area is growing as it becomes more popular for many looking to enjoy a night out.  The changes to the N205 are part of a series of improvements we are making to bus services and follows improvements introduced to the N26 last weekend.'",
     "This service change is part of TfL's management and development of a network that comprises around 700 routes across Greater London operated by 7,600 buses at peak times, carrying more than 2.4 billion passengers every year.",
     "TfL keeps the network under regular review, working with the London boroughs and other partners to help ensure that services can respond to London's changing travel needs.",
     "Notes to Editors:",
