     "In support of Shoreditch and Hackney's thriving social scene Transport\n        for London (TfL) will increase the frequency of the N26 night bus service from\n        this Friday (20 June).",
     "This will provide passengers in the area with more buses\n        at weekends east towards Leyton, Walthamstow and Chingford, and west into central\n        London to provide an easy interchange with other night bus services serving the\n        rest of the capital.",
     "This service improvement will see the\n        weekend night bus services, Friday night/Saturday mornings and Saturday night/Sunday\n        mornings, increase by two thirds with a bus every 12 minutes instead of the\n        current 20 minute service.  The service\n        improvement was made in response to an increase in passenger numbers seen on the\n        route.",
     "John Barry, TfL's Head of Network\n        Development for buses, said: \"Our night bus services are becoming increasingly popular and\n        this service improvement on route N26 will give more capacity.  It is great our night buses are enabling more\n        of our passengers to enjoy the thriving social scene that central London,\n        Shoreditch and Hackney offer while also providing a lifeline to many people who\n        work outside the nine to five routine.\"",
     "This service change is part\n        of TfL's management and development of a network that comprises around 700\n        routes across Greater London operated by 7,600 buses at peak times, carrying\n        more than 2.4 billion passengers every year. \n        TfL keeps the network under regular review, working with the London\n        boroughs and other partners to help ensure that services can respond to\n        London's changing travel needs.",
