     "With less than a month to go until the world's largest annual\n        sporting event comes to the City of London, Transport for London (TfL) is\n        holding a local information session to keep Londoners informed about the event.",
     "The iconic Tour de France will roll onto the streets of London on\n        Monday 7 July bringing out hundreds of thousands of Londoners and visitors to\n        see this spectacle.",
     "On\n        the day, a large number of road closures around the route will be in place so\n        people are advised to plan their travel in advance.",
     "Road closures for the event will begin after the morning peak at\n        10:00, with roads reopening as quickly as possible once the Tour has passed\n        through and it is safe to do so. TfL anticipates that all roads will be\n        reopened by 18:00. P",
     "edestrians will be able to cross the route at key crossing\n        points and we are working with local businesses close to the route to\n        ensure that disruption is kept to a minimum.\n         \n        The\n        A1211, which includes London Wall, will remain open all day, although it will\n        be busier than normal. Tower, Southwark and\n        Westminster Bridges will be closed for much of the day but there are no planned\n        closures on any other major river crossings in central London.",
     "An\n        extensive programme of public engagement and communication around the\n        arrival of the Tour de France in the capital is now underway similar to that\n        developed during the London 2012 Olympics, to help businesses and the public plan and get\n        around on the day and make the most of the return of the prestigious event.",
     "Londoners in the City are invited to attend a public information\n        session at the City Marketing Suite (within the Guildhall Complex)\n        on 26 June between 16:00 and 19:00. This will allow\n        members of the community to talk through the event and its impact on the local\n        area with representatives from TfL.",
     "The City of London will be a great place to\n        see the world's best riders as they pass sights such as St Paul's Cathedral,\n        the Tower of London and the Monument.",
     "Despite the road closures the City will\n        be, as ever, well and truly open for business, and people are encouraged to\n        enjoy the atmosphere provided by the riders and the publicity caravanne.",
     "The Tour de\n        France - the world's largest annual sporting event - comes to London on Monday 7\n        July after the first two stages in Yorkshire. Around 200 elite cyclists will\n        travel from Cambridge, through Essex, into London through Epping Forest before\n        a spectacular finish on The Mall.",
     "The Tour de\n        France will draw people onto the streets of London from near and far, and help\n        to inspire more people to take up cycling.",
     "Hosting world renowned events such\n        as the Tour reinforces London's reputation as a world-class host of cultural,\n        sporting and business events.",
     "Visitors, both domestic and overseas, are brought\n        to the capital by major events, delivering direct and indirect economic\n        benefits, and showcasing London to a much wider audience.",
     "arrett Emmerson,\n        Chief Operating Officer for Surface Transport at TfL, said: \"We've been working long and hard to plan\n        for this great event's return to the capital and now we are asking Londoners to\n        start their planning too.\n         \n        \"We will keep the capital moving, and roads around the race\n        route will, of course, be extremely busy.  So we're asking people to plan\n        ahead and preferably use public transport to make the most of what I'm sure\n        will be an amazing day that will help cement London's growing reputation as a\n        major cycling city and encourage more Londoners to travel by bike.\"",
     "Bus\n        services around the route will be affected. Routes 15, 42, 78, 100, 344 and RV1\n        which pass through the City will be affected by road closures. Some stops may\n        also be temporarily relocated or suspended.",
