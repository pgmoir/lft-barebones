     "Barclays\n        Cycle Hire is celebrating four successful years this week by giving Londoners\n        and visitors free access to cycle hire bikes across London on Saturday 16 and\n        Sunday 17 August.",
     "The cycle hire scheme was launched on 30 July 2010 and\n        since then over 32 million journeys have been made on cycle hire bikes.",
     "Over the\n        weekend of 16 and 17 August, anyone will be able to saddle up on a Barclays\n        Cycle Hire bike for a 24-hour period, and as long as the trips are under half\n        an hour they can make as many rides as they wish, all for free.",
     "The Mayor\n        of London, Boris Johnson, said: \"In my experience there is no greater way to\n        enjoy London than on two wheels and to celebrate our fantastic cycle hire\n        scheme's fourth birthday, we are offering everyone the chance to cycle around\n        our beautiful city for free. Whether you are an avid enthusiast or a cycling\n        novice, you'll be able to hop on a bike and take in some of our capital's most\n        iconic sights.\"",
     "Barclays\n        Cycle Hire has become an integral part of travelling around London and the\n        number of users, both new and regular, continues to grow. This July is set to\n        beat the previous record, set during the Olympic Games in 2012, for the number\n        of hires in a month with over 1.17m hires. Between March and June this year,\n        there was also a 30 per cent increase in the number of cycle hire trips\n        compared to the same period last year.",
     "The\n        scheme now covers over 100km² of London and more than 90 London Underground\n        stations (including the entire Circle line) and a number of major rail stations\n        such as Clapham Junction, Liverpool Street, Paddington and Putney are now all\n        within a short walk of a docking station, enabling more people to make cycling\n        part of their daily commute.",
     "To encourage\n        more people to take up cycling, and to help build confidence on two wheels,\n        British Cycling and Transport for London have teamed up to offer free group\n        rides. One ride will take place in Hyde Park on Saturday 16 August and a women\n        only bike ride to help encourage women to start cycling, will be held in\n        Regent's Park on Sunday 17 August.\n         \n        Each\n        group ride, which will take around 40 minutes to cover four and a half miles,\n        will be led by a trained British Cycling Ride leader along scenic, planned\n        routes. Bikes will be provided by TfL and there will be no charge.",
     "Nick\n        Aldworth, General Manager for Barclays Cycle Hire at TfL, said: \"We've had a\n        fantastic four years on Barclays Cycle Hire, with the distinctive bikes now\n        firmly part of daily life in London.  We're set to break our previous\n        record for the number of hires this month, with over 1,170,000 hires.\n         \n        \"If you\n        haven't tried the bikes before, you can give them a go for free during the\n        weekend of Saturday 16 and Sunday 17 August. Riding with others can be fun so\n        we've also teamed up with British Cycling to offer guided group rides in two\n        lovely central London parks. \n         \n        \"From\n        Notting Hill to Canary Wharf and Camden to Clapham Junction, people are\n        discovering how pleasant and handy it is to hop on our bikes to get around\n        town. So come and celebrate this special anniversary with us, and get pedalling.\"",
     "The Cycle\n        Hire scheme has seen many exciting developments over the last four years,\n        expanding to east London in 2012 and to south and west London last year. Three\n        new docking stations opened on Monday 28 July in Clapham Junction, Battersea -\n        handy for commuting or to access popular cycle routes on Wandsworth and Clapham\n        Commons.",
     "To help\n        Barclays Cycle Hire users discover London during the summer, TfL has created a\n        number of self-guided leisure cycle routes, many of which are on quieter roads.\n        Popular routes include London's Secret Gardens, Saturday Markets, Independent\n        Shops and Markets, and Quirky London.  The newest route, called Sporting\n        Sights, takes in famous sporting venues such as Stamford Bridge, Chelsea's\n        football ground, and the Kia Oval cricket ground.",
     "Cycle\n        hire users can pick up a free copy of the \"Explore London with Barclays Cycle\n        Hire\" map, which contains the above leisure routes, at central London Tube\n        stations, London Overground stations or by visiting www.tfl.gov.uk/leisureroutes\n         \n        Barclays Cycle Hire is easy\n        to use. Users can simply use a credit or debit card to hire a bike with no need\n        to book and from as little as £2 for 24 hours can make an unlimited number of\n        journeys under 30 minutes each time. Regular users can register for annual\n        membership, which equates to 25p per day and get the same unlimited number of\n        journeys under 30 minutes each without paying anything more. Alternatively,\n        they can register as a Pay as You Pedal member, which provides users with a\n        membership key for quick access to the bikes and a pay as you go facility",
