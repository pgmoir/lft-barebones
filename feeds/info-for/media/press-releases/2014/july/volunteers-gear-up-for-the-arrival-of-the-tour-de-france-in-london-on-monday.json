     "Hundreds\n        of volunteers will be hitting the streets of London to help ensure the success\n        of the third stage of the Tour de France next week on Monday 7 July.",
     "Transport\n        for London (TfL) Ambassadors will be out at key Tube and rail stations across\n        the capital to keep spectators informed and ensure London keeps moving.",
     "The\n        Tour de France - the world's largest annual sporting event - returns to London\n        on Monday 7 July after two stages in Yorkshire. Around 200 elite cyclists will\n        travel from Cambridge, through Essex and into London before a spectacular\n        finish on The Mall.",
     "The iconic Tour de France will draw people onto the streets\n        of London from near and far, and help to inspire more people to take up\n        cycling.",
     "TfL\n        has been undertaking an extensive programme of public engagement and\n        communication regarding the arrival of the Tour with residents and businesses\n        across the capital. This is designed to ensure people living and working in\n        London can understand the potential impacts of the Tour and plan ahead to avoid\n        unnecessary inconvenience.",
     "On\n        Monday 7 July, road closures for the event through north, east, and central\n        London will begin after the morning peak at 10:00, with roads reopening as\n        quickly as possible once the Tour has passed through and it is safe to do so.\n        TfL anticipates that all roads will be reopened by 18:00.",
     "Closures\n        will affect the boroughs of Redbridge, Waltham Forest, Hackney, Newham, Tower\n        Hamlets, City, Westminster, Lambeth and Southwark. Tower, Southwark and\n        Westminster Bridges will be closed for much of the day however there are no\n        planned closures on any other major river crossings in Central London. Maps\n        showing the areas inside the M25 that will be affected by the race are\n        available at tfl.gov.uk/tourdefrance,\n        along with a range of advice.",
     "To avoid delays drivers are\n        advised to, wherever possible, avoid areas near the event routes in the\n        affected parts of Cambridgeshire, Essex and London.\n         \n        Pedestrians will be able to\n        cross the route at designated, marshalled crossing points and Tube and rail\n        services will be the best way to get around and enjoy the day. Stations along\n        the route, and particularly in Zone 1, are expected to be busy during the evening\n        peak.",
     "Garrett Emmerson, Chief\n        Operating Officer of Surface Transport at TfL, said: \"Our job is to keep the\n        capital moving, and our 250 strong team of Ambassadors will be out at major\n        transport hubs helping people get to the race and around London. However, roads\n        around the race route will be extremely busy, so we're asking people to plan\n        ahead and preferably use public transport. This will help to make the most of\n        what I'm sure will be an amazing day, cementing London's growing reputation as\n        a major cycling city and encourage more Londoners to travel by bike.\"",
     "There\n        will be a range of ways for Londoners and visitors to get into the spirit of\n        the event. Spectators will be able to watch the action pass through local roads\n        along the route with the Tour's Publicity Caravan providing entertainment and\n        some promotional goodies in the hours before the riders pass through. Race fans\n        can also check out one of London's spectator hubs, where TfL Ambassadors will\n        be joined by Team London Ambassadors and Tour de France Hub Tour Makers all\n        providing key advice and assistance to Londoners and visitors across the\n        capital.",
     "Volunteers\n        will be lining the route throughout the day as well as being at Green Park and\n        Trafalgar Square official Fan Parks, and the spectator hub at Hopkins Field,\n        Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. These will be open between Saturday 5 and Monday\n        7 July, and will host a variety of activities. The spectator hubs will be free\n        to attend and an ideal location to watch the race live on giant screens and get\n        in the Tour de France spirit.\n         \n        They\n        will feature a wide range of activities such as a food market, a Tour de France\n        Museum, interactive cycling activities, an outdoor cinema, live music,\n        celebrity appearances and shops showcasing all of the latest bike equipment and\n        accessories.",
     "There will be an additional big screen set up at Queen Elizabeth\n        Olympic Park for spectators to enjoy the whole of Stage 3 live.\n         \n        Hosting\n        world renowned events such as the Tour reinforces London's reputation as a\n        world-class host of cultural, sporting and business events. Visitors, both\n        domestic and overseas, are brought to the capital by major events, delivering\n        direct and indirect economic benefits, and showcasing London to a much wider\n        audience.\n         \n        For\n        more information, please visit tfl.gov.uk/tourdefrance"
