     "Transport for London (TfL) and MTR have now signed the contract\n        for the operation of Crossrail services.",
     "The £1.4 billion contract is for eight\n        years with an option to extend to ten years.",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\"}",
     "They will\n        start running services between Liverpool Street and Shenfield from 31 May 2015,\n        taking over the stopping services currently operated by Abellio Greater Anglia.\n        They will be staffing all stations along the route from the first to last\n        train.",
     "Mike Brown MVO, Managing Director\n        London Underground and London Rail, said: \"The appointment of MTR brings\n        Crossrail services another step forward. They will be operating London's newest\n        rail line which will help cut journey times, make it easier for people\n        travelling across the city and create jobs and support growth and regeneration\n        along the route. We will be looking to MTR to operate reliable and efficient\n        Crossrail train services from day one.\"",
     "Jay Walder, Chief Executive Officer of\n        MTR Corporation, said: \"We are committed to bringing the very best of MTR to\n        Crossrail, and are working hand-in-hand with TfL to establish a new standard of\n        operational reliability and customer experience for railways in Europe. The\n        award of this contract also shows how Hong Kong's expertise and capabilities\n        can contribute to the growth and development of world cities.\"",
     "With London's\n        population set to increase to 10 million by 2030 Crossrail will provide a vital\n        boost in rail capacity in the capital. It will connect Reading and Heathrow in\n        the west with Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east.",
     "Crossrail\n        will be fully integrated as part of the TfL network providing a fast, frequent\n        service linking the east and west and relieving congestion on some of the\n        busiest Tube lines.",
     "Passengers using Crossrail will see reduced journey times and the new stations will be integrated with\n        existing London Underground, DLR, London Overground and National Rail stations\n        making it easy for passengers to change between services.",
