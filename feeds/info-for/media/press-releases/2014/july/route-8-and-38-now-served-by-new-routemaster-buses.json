     "They become the seventh and eighth bus routes\n        in the capital to operate with the world's greenest diesel electric hybrid\n        buses",
     "From today (Wednesday 2 July)\n        routes 8 and 38 have become the latest in the capital to be served entirely by\n        New Routemasters.",
     "They are the cleanest and greenest diesel electric hybrid\n        double deck buses in the world and are part of a comprehensive programme to\n        reduce emissions from London's bus fleet.",
     "To date, six bus routes in\n        London have been served by around 170 New Routemasters. By 2016 there will be\n        600 of these new buses on London's streets reducing CO2 emissions in\n        the capital by around 20,600 tonnes a year.",
     "Route 38, which is operated by\n        Arriva, has had New Routemasters introduced on a phased basis with full\n        conversion now complete. It runs between\n        Victoria Station and Hackney, via Hyde Park Corner, Green Park, Piccadilly\n        Circus, Bloomsbury, Islington, Dalston, Hackney Central Station and Clapton\n        Pond.",
     "It was the route on which the very first prototype New Routemaster\n        entered service in February 2012. At night, route\n        N38 has an extended service running additionally via Lea Bridge,\n        Leyton (Bakers Arms) and Walthamstow Central which will also be served by New\n        Routemaster buses.",
     "Buses on route 38 operate with the\n        rear door open and a conductor on the rear platform for the majority of the day\n        on weekdays (6am-7pm Monday to Friday) on the busiest section of the route\n        between Essex Road (Islington) and Victoria. On the remainder of the route, in\n        the evenings, at weekends and on the route N38 at night the rear platform is\n        closed when the bus is moving but all three sets of doors are opened and closed\n        by the driver at bus stops. During peaks hours, 59 of these state of the art\n        buses are in passenger service to carry the 42,000 people who travel on the\n        route each week day.",
     "In addition, the routes 8 and N8 are now also served entirely by New\n        Routemasters. Operated by Stagecoach, it runs for 24-hours a day and has seen\n        New Routemasters introduced on a phased basis with full conversion now\n        complete. The route normally runs between\n        Oxford Circus and Bow Church via Tottenham Court Road, Holborn, St Paul's,\n        Bank, Liverpool Street, Shoreditch and Bethnal Green,\n        although until autumn 2014 it terminates at Tottenham Court Road due to\n        roadworks.",
     "At night, route N8 has an extended service running additionally via\n        Stratford, Leytonstone, and Gants to Hainault which is now also served by New\n        Routemaster buses. Buses on route 8 and N8\n        operate with the rear platform closed when the bus is moving, with large\n        numbers of passengers able to quickly board and alight using all three sets of\n        doors and two staircases at bus stops.",
     "During peak hours, 30 of the new\n        buses are in passenger service to carry the 22,000 passengers\n        who travel on the route each weekday.\n         \n        The introduction of New Routemaster\n        buses is part of a comprehensive programme to reduce emissions from London's\n        bus fleet which includes 1,700 hybrids on the street by 2016, accelerating the\n        introduction of ultra low emission Euro VI buses and retrofitting older buses\n        to reduce their NOx emissions by up to 88 per cent.\n         \n        Four New Routemasters with a Euro\n        VI engine are currently being tested in passenger service with full production\n        of the New Routemaster with the Euro VI engine starting later this year.",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"In tests, a New\\n            Routemaster prototype bus was found to emit a quarter of the NOx (Oxides\\n            of Nitrogen) and harmful 'PM' particles of a fleet average hybrid bus and\\n            20 per cent less CO2.Arriva is one of the\\n            largest providers of passenger transport in Europe, employing some 54,500\\n            people and delivering more than 2.2 billion passenger journeys every year.\",\"Arriva is part of Deutsche Bahn, one of the world's leading passenger\\n            transport and logistics service providers, and operates in 14 European\\n            countries.
