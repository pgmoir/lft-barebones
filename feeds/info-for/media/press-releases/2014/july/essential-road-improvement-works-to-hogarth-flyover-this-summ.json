     "As part of Transport for\n        London (TfL)'s work to maintain its structures, essential works to Hogarth\n        Flyover in west London will take place from 19 July as part of a continuing\n        programme of roads modernisation across London.",
     "Hogarth Flyover is nearly 50\n        years old and now requires essential maintenance work to ensure it continues to\n        serve the area for the next 20 to 30 years.",
     "If the works are not done soon,\n        then the structure may become unsafe, which would require TfL to close the\n        flyover at very short notice.",
     "From 19 July until 31\n        August, the single lane eastbound only flyover, which carries traffic from the\n        A316 onto the A4 Great West Road, will be closed to traffic to allow engineers to\n        replace the deck, repair parapets steelwork, and improve lighting on the slip\n        road. The essential refurbishment works have been phased and coordinated to\n        take place during the summer when traffic levels are significantly lower,\n        helping to reduce the impact on road users.",
     "Drivers are advised to allow\n        extra time for their journeys as these works will have an impact on a wider\n        area than the immediate vicinity of the works.",
     "Where possible, drivers are\n        advised to change their routes and plan ahead to avoid the disruption,\n        particularly during the morning and evening peak during weekdays and if\n        travelling at the weekend.",
     "To help local residents and\n        businesses prepare, TfL has worked with key partners, including the local\n        boroughs, and has written to local residents, businesses, local transport\n        groups and other stakeholders.",
     "Variable messaging signs will be placed on the\n        roadside advising drivers of the closures and information is being shared with\n        affected residents and other road users in a huge variety of ways - including\n        emails, social media feeds, TfL's website and across a range of print and\n        broadcast media. TfL will be providing real-time updates through the\n        @tfltrafficnews twitter feed and website to help drivers plan their journey - www.tfl.gov.uk/trafficnews.",
     "Garrett Emmerson, Chief\n        Operating Officer for Surface Transport at TfL, said: \"London is living with\n        the legacy of life expired 1960s roads infrastructure; now we need to prepare\n        for the next 30 years. These important works to the Hogarth Flyover will ensure\n        that this vital structure can remain open for years to come, reducing the need\n        for further works in the future while ensuring traffic can continue to flow\n        into and around London.\n         \n        \"Whilst there is obviously\n        no perfect time to close such an essential piece of road infrastructure for\n        major maintenance, doing it during the school summer holidays when traffic\n        levels are up to 15 per cent lower, and working 24hrs, seven days a week to complete\n        the works in just six weeks, will minimise disruption for Londoners on this\n        important road corridor.\"",
     "Additionally in the area,\n        Wandsworth Council are carrying out essential works to refurbish Putney Bridge\n        from 14 July.",
     "The works will affect journeys over a wider area than the\n        immediate vicinity of Putney Bridge. Traffic is expected to be congested in the\n        surrounding area especially during morning and evening peaks, with alternative\n        river crossings likely to be most congested. We advise drivers to allow extra\n        time for journeys and, where possible, to change route to avoid the disruption.\n         \n        London Buses will operate\n        service from both ends of the bridge, and bus passengers who would usually\n        cross the bridge will need to make their way across to the other side to\n        continue their journeys. Bus passengers from affected routes who cross the\n        bridge on foot will be able to continue their journey on to appropriate\n        services on the other side.\n         \n        TfL has set out plans to\n        ensure that bus passengers don't lose out and don't pay twice when their\n        journeys are affected by the bridge closure.
