     "Transport for London (TfL)\n        is reminding customers who use Euston Underground station that the\n        refurbishment of two escalators will begin next week on Thursday 10 July.",
     "The escalator refurbishment\n        will ensure a more reliable service for customers in coming years as the Tube\n        carries ever more passengers.",
     "The two escalators will be\n        refurbished one after the other from July 2014 with the work expected to be\n        complete in late March 2015.",
     "While the work is carried\n        out there will be no down escalator to the southbound Victoria or Northern\n        (Bank branch) line platforms from Thursday 10 July until early November 2014\n        and no down escalator to the northbound Victoria or Northern (Bank branch) line\n        platforms from early November 2014 until late March 2015.",
     "During the refurbishment\n        customers will only be able to use the spiral staircase to access these\n        platforms.",
     "The station will be very busy, especially during the\n        morning and evening peaks. It may be quicker for customers to walk or catch a\n        bus to nearby Warren Street or King's Cross St. Pancras stations instead. \n        Customers changing between the Charing Cross and Bank branches on the Northern\n        line are advised to do so at Camden Town instead of Euston.",
     "The refurbishment of the\n        escalators at Euston includes the removal and replacement of hundreds of\n        mechanical and electrical parts.",
     "The refurbishment is part of the continuing\n        Tube investment programme with major stations, trains, track and signalling\n        being modernised or replaced to provide more capacity for a growing city.\n         \n        Escalators on the\n        Underground are longer and more heavy duty than most. They carry huge volumes\n        of people and run for approximately 20 hours a day.  The escalators that\n        will be refurbished are used by just under 60,000 people a day - enough to fill\n        the Emirates Stadium.",
     "Nigel Holness, Operations\n        Director for London Underground, said: \"The escalator refurbishment due to take\n        place at Euston is vital to ensure their continued reliable operation for\n        customers as passenger numbers continue to rise. \n         \n        \"I apologise for the\n        disruption the refurbishment will cause to customers using the station and we\n        have plans in place to help customers complete their journeys with as little\n        impact as possible.\"",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"London\\n            Underground LU is undertaking a major programme of renewal which will\\n            inevitably result in some disruption for passengers, but Transport for London\\n            is working hard to provide information and alternative travel options.\",\"The work is essential to provide for London's growing transport needs now, and\\n            into the future\",\"TfL\\n            is urging all Londoners and Tube, London Overground, London Tramlink DLR and\\n            National Rail passengers to \\\"check before you travel\\\", allowing extra journey\\n            time where necessary.
