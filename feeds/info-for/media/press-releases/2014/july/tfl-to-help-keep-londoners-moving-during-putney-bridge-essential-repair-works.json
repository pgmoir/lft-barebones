     "In\n        advance of Wandsworth Council's essential repair works to Putney Bridge\n        starting next week (Monday 14 July), Transport for London (TfL) is advising\n        drivers of disruption to the surrounding area, and is reiterating its\n        commitment to ensure that bus passengers don't lose out or pay twice if their\n        journeys are affected by the bridge closure.",
     "The\n        bridge needs better protection from the damage caused by water penetration -\n        which has contributed to the poor road surface.",
     "During the works, which the\n        council estimate will last for around three months, all vehicles, including\n        buses, will not be able to use the bridge.",
     "Drivers will need to change their\n        route to complete their journey and should allow extra time for their\n        alternative routes.",
     "Pedestrians will still be able to cross the bridge on foot,\n        as will cyclists - although they will need to dismount. Buses will terminate\n        either side of the bridge.",
     "The\n        Putney Bridge repair works will affect journeys over a wider area than the\n        immediate vicinity of the bridge.",
     "Traffic is expected to be congested around\n        the works especially during morning and evening peaks, with alternative river\n        crossings expected to be most disrupted.\n        Â \n        Additional\n        traffic is expected in the morning peak across Kew Bridge, along the A316\n        across Chiswick Bridge, northbound journeys across Hammersmith Bridge, and\n        around Clapham Junction. Variable messaging signs are now in place, advising\n        drivers of the closures, and TfL will be providing up to date information\n        through the @tfltrafficnews twitter feed and website to help drivers plan their\n        journey - tfl.gov.uk/trafficnews.",
     "London\n        Buses will operate services from both ends of the bridge, and bus passengers\n        who would usually cross the bridge will need to make their way across to the\n        other side to continue their journey. Bus passengers from affected routes who\n        cross the bridge on foot will be able to continue their journey on to\n        appropriate services from the other side.",
     "During\n        the works, the frequency of the Route 72 between Roehampton and Hammersmith\n        will be doubled (from around 7 to 15 buses an hour Monday to Saturday daytime\n        and from 5 to 10 buses an hour on Sunday daytime) to provide an alternative\n        link to the London Underground (LU) network from that part of London.",
     "TfL has also worked to make\n        sure that any customers who may have difficulty crossing the bridge can still\n        get where they need to go by using alternative services. All buses are accessible and alternative routes, such as 37,\n        39 and 265 linking Putney and Wandsworth Town, and 485 from Hammersmith to\n        Putney will be available. TfL will have additional staff in place on either\n        side of Putney Bridge to help direct passengers and answer any questions about\n        where to get buses from.",
     "Passengers\n        with Travelcards or who travel for free under a concession (around 90 per cent\n        of passengers) will be able to walk across the bridge and continue their\n        journey as normal. Anyone using Oyster pay as you go (PAYG) or a contactless\n        payment card (who make up around 10 per cent of affected passengers) will be\n        able to obtain a \"transfer card\" from the bus driver or a dedicated members of\n        staff, which will mean that they also will not have to pay for the second leg\n        of their journey.",
     "Transfer\n        cards can be used in conjunction with an Oyster PAYG or Contactless payment\n        cards which are validated within 60 minutes on a previous bus journey on routes\n        14, 22, 39, 74, 85, 93, 220, 265, 270, 424, 430, N22 and N74. Passengers who\n        have a transfer card can use it throughout the bridge closure and will not need\n        to obtain a transfer voucher from the driver on each occasion.",
     "Garrett\n        Emmerson, Chief Operating Officer of Surface Transport at TfL, said: \"We urge\n        all drivers to plan their journeys in advance to minimise the affect of the\n        council's essential works to Putney Bridge. By taking alternative routes,\n        disruption will be minimised. We will also be ensuring that any bus passengers\n        affected by the works can continue their journey in the quickest and easiest\n        way possible.\"",
     "TfL\n        will also be carrying out essential road works to Hogarth Flyover from 19 July\n        until 31 August as part of a continuing programme of roads modernisation across\n        London. Drivers are advised to allow extra time for their journeys as these\n        works will have an impact on a wider area than the immediate vicinity of the\n        flyover. Where possible, drivers are advised to plan ahead to change their\n        routes avoid the disruption, particularly during the morning and evening peak\n        during weekdays and if travelling at the weekend.",
