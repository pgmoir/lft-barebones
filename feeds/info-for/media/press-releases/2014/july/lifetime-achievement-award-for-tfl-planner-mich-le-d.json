     "Michèle Dix, Transport for\n        London's Managing Director of Planning, has been presented with a lifetime\n        achievement award recognising her outstanding contribution to transport planning\n        in the capital.",
     "The award was presented by\n        Daniel Parker-Klein, Director PTRC Education \u0026\n        Research Services Ltd, at the 12th PRTC conference at the Emirates\n        Stadium last night.",
     "The award is presented to leading figures in\n        the transport world recognising their long term commitment and contribution to\n        the transport planning profession.",
     "Previous winners have included David Quarmby, Malcolm Buchannan and Professor Peter Jones.",
     "Michèle Dix, said: \"It is an\n        honour to receive this award and it is rather apt to receive it this year when\n        TfL is celebrating 100 years of women working in transport. There are many\n        things in my career I am proud of but several stand out; implementing the\n        Congestion Charge, developing the Mayor's Transport Strategy and the work I am\n        doing on the Roads Task Force to ensure the road network is fit for the 21st\n        century. The cable car in east London was also a great achievement having been\n        conceived, built and delivered all within two years.  This pedestrian and\n        cyclist crossing is instrumental to the area's regeneration and will be\n        complemented by the Silvertown Tunnel and further crossings to support growth\n        in the area.\n         \n        \"With London's population\n        set to grow to 10 million by 2030 my team and I will continue to ensure that\n        the city's transport needs are met and to support social and economic growth.\"",
     "Sir Peter Hendy CBE,\n        London's Transport Commissioner said: \"Michèle is a fantastic transport\n        planner, I would argue the best in Britain!  She has been involved in\n        introducing many successful schemes in the capital and her contribution to\n        developing our city has been immeasurable.  As London continues to grow,\n        she plays an essential role in planning for the future while we continue to\n        improve services.  She thoroughly deserves this lifetime achievement\n        award.\n         \n        \"I'm also really pleased\n        that Kerri Rogan, Head of Corporate Affairs, has been recognised at this event\n        for her excellent, ground-breaking paper on cycling and gender differences.\"",
     "Kerri Rogan, TfL's Head of\n        Corporate Affairs, also won an award last night. She was awarded the 2013\n        Voorhees Large prize for her Transport Masters dissertation 'A mixed method\n        study of gender differences in pedal cyclists' risks in London'. Kerri started her career as a transport planner on TfL's graduate scheme,\n        and has worked in a variety of roles at TfL, including the planning and\n        operational delivery of the 2012 Olympic Games, designing and delivering\n        schemes for cycling and urban realm in London and, outside of TfL, advising the\n        Senior Traffic Commissioner of Great Britain.",
     "Michèle has been the\n        Managing Director of Planning at TfL since June 2007, taking the role as a job\n        share with Malcolm Murray-Clark, demonstrating such a high level role could be\n        done as a job share. Prior to that, she was co-Director of Congestion Charging\n        with Malcolm implementing running and expanding the scheme as well as\n        developing the Low Emission Zone. Her role has seen her work across all areas\n        of transport in the capital from designing bus lanes, pedestrian modelling at\n        London Underground stations and developing strategies for airports. She also\n        shares her knowledge and experience globally, working with the international\n        transport body the UITP.",
     "Daniel\n        Parker-Klein, Director PTRC Education \u0026 Research Services Ltd said: \"It is\n        an honour to present Michele Dix with the 2014 PTRC lifetime achievement award.\n        Throughout her career Michele has demonstrated a drive and dedication to\n        improve transport in London and beyond culminating in the successes of the\n        London Congestion Charge and the more recent Roads Task Force. I cannot think\n        of a more fitting figure on the 100th anniversary of women working\n        in transport to receive this prestigious award.\"",
     "Michèle started her career\n        at the Greater London Council (GLC) after completing her PhD in transport and\n        land use planning. She became a chartered civil engineer through the GLC's\n        transport planning graduate scheme. Michèle later joined Halcrow Fox in the\n        private sector, where she became the Board Director of Urban Transport Planning\n        before joining TfL in 2000.",
     "2014 marks 100 years of women working in transport with women taking\n        on roles in the First World War and being involved in building landmarks such\n        as Waterloo Bridge, often dubbed the 'Ladies Bridge' which opened in December\n        1945."
