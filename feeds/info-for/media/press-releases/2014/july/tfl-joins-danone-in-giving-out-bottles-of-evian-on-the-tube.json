     "Customers\n        reminded to carry water while travelling on the Tube",
     "evian\n        supplies passengers with 250,000 free bottles of water this summer",
     "First\n        giveaway taking place today at Waterloo Underground Station",
     "Transport for London (TfL) has teamed up with\n        Danone Waters UK \u0026 Ireland Ltd to give out free\n        bottles of evian natural mineral water to customers, helping to emphasise the\n        advice to carry water while travelling on the Tube.",
     "As\n        the hot weather in the capital continues, Danone has provided London\n        Underground with 250,000 bottles of evian water, which will be given out at\n        some of the busiest stations on the London Underground network this summer in\n        support of TfL's ongoing Beat the Heat and Travel Better London campaign.",
     "The\n        campaign aims to raise awareness of how passengers can help to reduce delays\n        and improve the environment for themselves and fellow travellers by making\n        small changes to their travel habits.",
     "The\n        company has also agreed a three-year partnership with Transport for London\n        which will see additional water distribution days across the Tube network\n        during the summer months until 2017. The partnership will help secure evian's\n        presence across London, which is also supported by its annual Live Young\n        January campaigns and sponsorship of The Championships at Wimbledon.",
     "Phil Hufton, LU's Chief Operating Officer, said: \"We know\n        travelling around London during the summer months can be uncomfortable but we\n        are making real headway towards cooling the Tube. New air conditioned trains\n        are operating on the Metropolitan, Circle and Hammersmith \u0026 City lines and\n        are being rolled out on the District line. By the end of 2016, 40 per cent of\n        the network will be served by air conditioned trains. However, there is still\n        work to do. Cooling the deeper lines of the Tube is the big engineering\n        challenge - but we're making significant steps forward and are not complacent about\n        finding solutions.",
     "\"We're grateful to Danone for supplying customers with water and, while we make improvements across the network,\n        passengers can also play a key role in helping us to deliver an even more\n        efficient service. I'm sure this partnership will be\n        welcomed by customers as temperatures are set to rise, and I hope that it gets\n        across the advice that we are giving to customers to carry water while\n        travelling on the Tube.\"",
     "Sophie Brooks, evian senior brand manager, said: \"We are delighted\n        to have teamed up with TFL to give overheated commuters some Live Young\n        refreshment. It is really important to stay hydrated during the hot\n        weather so it is great to have the chance to help Londoners keep cool.\"",
     "TfL gives the following advice to customers travelling on the Tube\n        in the summer months:\n        Carry\n        water with you; Don't board a train or bus if you feel unwell;If you feel unwell please get off at the next stop and\n        seek help from our staff  and;Avoid pulling the passenger alarm between stations, and\n        get off of the train at the next stop as help can be more easily obtained\n        on a platform",
