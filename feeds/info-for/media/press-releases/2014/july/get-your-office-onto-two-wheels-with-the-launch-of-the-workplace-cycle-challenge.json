     "Focusing\n        on participation, the Workplace Cycle Challenge runs until 1 August and looks\n        to see which London businesses can get the most people to ride a bike for 10\n        minutes or more.",

Whether this will be your first time on a bike for a long\n        time, or you are a seasoned commuter cyclist, the emphasis is simply on giving\n        cycling a try.\"",

     "The Mayor is committed to ensuring London\n        retains its status as the world capital of sport, and has recently set up the\n        Major Events Oversight Board. The board is chaired by Sir Edward Lister, and\n        comprises of TfL, the emergency services and other key partner agencies. It\n        provides strategic direction and advice to the Mayor on the approach to\n        bidding, staging and evaluating major events in London. The board ensures that\n        all major road events continue to be carefully considered and tightly managed\n        to ensure everyone gets full benefit from the event without undue impact on\n        Londoners and London's transport. The board also looks at ways to ensure the\n        major events programme is effectively communicated with Londoners, visitors,\n        businesses and stakeholders to allow sufficient notice and forward planning for\n        everyone"
