     "Walworth Bus Depot occupies\n        a site originally acquired as a tram depot in 1891. It was known as the\n        Camberwell Tram Depot until 1950 when its name changed to Walworth with the\n        arrival of buses at the site. Major rebuilding work took place during the 1950s\n        to repair bomb damage from the Second World War. The current depot re-opened in\n        2004 after being fully refurbished with the latest environmental technology\n        including solar panels on the roof.",
     "The first bus garage open\n        day was held at Catford on 10 May and attracted around 3,000 visitors. Since\n        then, Alperton, Stockwell, Fulwell and Potters Bar Bus Garages have all opened\n        their doors to the public to offer behind-the-scenes access in celebration of\n        the Year of the Bus.\n         \n        The last bus garage open day\n        will take place at Dartford Bus Garage on Sunday 7 September.",
     "Events and activities are\n        being held throughout 2014 to celebrate the role that London buses, bus drivers\n        and the staff who support them play in keeping the capital moving, and mark a\n        number of important anniversaries. These include 60 years since the creation of\n        the original and iconic Routemaster, 75 years since the launch of its\n        predecessor the RT-type bus, and 100 years since hundreds of London buses were\n        sent to the Western Front to play a crucial role during the First World War.",
     "Buses are a vital daily service\n        for millions and one that is very local, with the vast majority of Londoners\n        (95 per cent) never more than 400 metres from a bus stop.  Buses link\n        homes to jobs, schools and hospitals in every part of the capital.  They\n        are the backbone, and often the forgotten workhorses, of London's transport\n        network.",
