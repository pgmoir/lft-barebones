     "Transport for London (TfL) and Briggs Marine and Environmental Services are carrying out maintenance works on the jetty which gives traffic access to and from the A205 South Circular on the south side of the Woolwich Ferry.",
     "These works will ensure that this important service can continue to provide a link across the River Thames for years to come and are expected to be completed by the end of May 2014.",
     "The jetty was first constructed in the mid-1960s and is being refurbished to ensure its continued safety and reliability.",
     "To allow this essential work to take place safely some temporary lane closures are necessary which may cause some delays for vehicles using the Woolwich Ferry.",
     "These lane closures are unavoidable but traffic management is in place to ensure delays are kept to a minimum.",
     "Andrew Thompson, Head of London River Services, said: `We apologise for any inconvenience caused to your journey while these essential maintenance works are ongoing.",
     "`We are doing our upmost to ensure any delays are kept to the minimum wherever possible.'",
     "The ferry is continuing to operate throughout these works.",
     "To avoid delays at peak times while the works are ongoing, the nearest alternative river crossings for normal traffic (excluding some heavy good vehicles) is the Blackwall Tunnel.",
     "The Rotherhithe Tunnel or Tower Bridge are other alternatives, with the recently refurbished Foot Tunnel - which has entrances adjacent to the ferry terminals at Woolwich - an option for those wanting to cross on foot.",
     "Once the work on the south side viaduct is complete, works will begin on the north side with similar lane closures required.",
     "A start date for these works will be announced nearer the time.",
