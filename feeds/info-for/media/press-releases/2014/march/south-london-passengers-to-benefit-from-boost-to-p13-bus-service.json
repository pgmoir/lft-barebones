     "Bus journeys in south London are being made easier from Saturday 22 March as Transport for London (TfL) increases the frequency of the P13 bus route to meet growing demand between Streatham Rail Station and New Cross Gate.",
     "This will see the frequency of service increase by a third.",
     "On Monday to Saturday daytimes, and on Sundays during shopping hours services will increase to a bus every 15 minutes compared with the current service of a bus every 20 minutes.",
     "During the evenings the service will run every 20 minutes, instead of every 30 minutes.",
     "John Barry, Head of Bus Network Development for TfL, said: `We identified an increase in passenger demand on route P13 as part of our regular monitoring of the bus network.",
     "`We believe that this service improvement will deliver real benefits, particularly for those making journeys across south London.'",
     "For added passenger convenience dual-door single-deck buses will be introduced on to the route when they become available later this year.",
     "This will speed up boarding and alighting, as well as increasing passenger capacity.",
     "This service improvement is part of TfL's management and development of a network that comprises around 700 routes across Greater London operated by 7,600 buses at peak times, carrying more than 2.3 billion passengers every year.",
     "TfL keeps the network under regular review, working with the London boroughs and other partners to help ensure that services can respond to London's changing travel needs.",
     "Demand and reliability is monitored very closely and regular changes are made to schedules and routes as a result.",
     "Bus service levels in London have increased by over 40 per cent since the formation of TfL in 2000 and reliability and customer satisfaction are at the highest levels since records began."
