     "Phil Young, TfL's Head of Online, said:",
     "'Our new website puts customers in control, with more live travel information and options making it easier than ever to plan and make journeys in London.",
     "'We have listened carefully to what our customers told us they want from our website and we have used that feedback to shape the information services we offer.  In particular, we have designed the site so that it can be used more easily on mobile, tablet or laptop, as more customers and users check and plan journeys while on the move.",
     "\"We will continue to develop the site based on customer feedback so that it continues to be an essential travel companion in making the most of all London has to offer.\"",
     "Since launching in beta mode in July 2013, more than two million customers have visited the site, testing out the new features and providing feedback.  Around 6,000 feedback forms were received and used to ensure the new site meets customers' needs.",
     "TfL's last major website update was in 2007 and the team took lessons from how customer information was provided during the London 2012 Games to improve the design and functionality for the new site.",
