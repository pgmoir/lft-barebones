     "The Emirates Air Line is to be closed for important and planned maintenance work for one week from Monday 17 to Sunday 23 March 2014.",
     "The work that will be carried out is a statutory requirement and is in line with annual essential maintenance programmes that take place on cable cars around the world.",
     "However this closure period is shorter than others as a result of a busy schedule of different types of work being carried out simultaneously, and the continual maintenance that takes place throughout the year.",
     "The nature of the work means that daylight hours are needed to deliver this safely.",
     "It will include electrical testing, comprehensive weight testing for each of the 36 cabins and a full inspection of the sheave wheels that the cable passes through at the top of the three helix towers.",
     "TfL's Head of the Emirates Air Line, Danny Price said: `Since opening nearly two years ago the Emirates Air Line has carried over 3.4 million passengers and has had consistently high levels of customer satisfaction.",
     "`We want to ensure that it continues to do so and performing this routine maintenance work is a crucial part of that.",
     "`We apologise for any disruption this causes passengers.",
     "`By carrying out all of this vital work now we will not require any further planned closures this year.'",
     "While the closure is in place the nearest alternative public transport is North Greenwich Tube station on the south side of the Emirates Air Line served by the Jubilee line and Royal Victoria DLR station on the north side of the scheme.",
     "Both are a short walk away from the Emirates Air Line. Bus services are available from North Greenwich bus station and Royal Victoria.",
     "River services also operate from North Greenwich Pier next to the Emirates Greenwich Peninsula terminal.",
     "Since opening customer feedback has been consistently high with the Emirates Air Line receiving an average score of 93 out of 100, for both overall satisfaction and likelihood to recommend the service to others.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFor information about local public transport and to plan your journey, please visit \u003ca href=\"http://tfl.gov.uk/journeyplanner\"\u003ehttp://tfl.gov.uk/journeyplanner\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e",
