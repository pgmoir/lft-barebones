     "Passengers using the route 59 bus will benefit from a cleaner, greener and more regular service from today, Monday 31 March, as Transport for London (TfL) increases the frequency to meet growing demand.",
     "It has also introduced hybrid buses to the route which operates between Streatham Hill (Telford Avenue) and Kings Cross station.",
     "The service improvement will see the frequency of the route increased towards Kings Cross in the morning peak to a bus every 4 to 5 minutes compared to the current every 5 to 6 minutes now, and towards Streatham Hill in the evening peak to a bus every 5 to 6 minutes compared to up to every 6 to 7 minutes now.",
     "Off peak and Saturday daytime services will remain at every 6 to 7 minutes as now.",
     "The service improvements have been made in response to a 10 per cent increase in passenger demand on this route during the last four years.",
     "A fleet of 21 cleaner and greener double deck hybrid buses has been introduced onto this route, which not only provides passengers with a smoother and more comfortable ride, but also helps reduce the capital's CO2 emissions and pollution.",
     "This will also mean the majority of the buses operated on this route will be using hybrid technology.",
     "John Barry, Head of Bus Network Development for TfL, said: `London's bus network is kept under constant review and we will make changes, where possible, to improve the service we offer our passengers.",
     "`This route connects many busy London Underground and National Rail stations and the introduction of these extra services, especially at the height of the peak, will really benefit the many passengers who use this route.'",
     "This service improvement is part of TfL's management and development of a network that comprises around 700 routes across Greater London operated by 7,600 buses at peak times, carrying more than 2.3 billion passengers every year.",
     "TfL keeps the network under regular review, working with the London boroughs and other partners to help ensure that services can respond to London's changing travel needs.",
     "Demand and reliability is monitored very closely and regular changes are made to schedules and routes as a result.",
     "Bus service levels in London have increased by over 40 per cent since the formation of TfL in 2000 and reliability and customer satisfaction are at the highest levels since records began.",
