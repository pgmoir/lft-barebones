     "Smarter design of our roads and public spaces, ... will play a key role in ensuring that London remains the best big city to live, work and invest",
     "Dozens of locations across the capital are set to be transformed in a £4 billion programme as part of the largest investment in the capital's road and street network in a generation.",
     "In response to the recommendations of the Mayor's Roads Task Force, which last July unveiled a bold new vision to radically improve London's roads, streets and public spaces, a total of 50 projects are now underway.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAlongside the transformation of 33 of London's biggest and nastiest road junctions announced last week as part of the Mayor's cycling programme, there will also be more than £200m of additional far-reaching improvements at 17 major locations across the capital, including at; Croydon Fiveways;  Balham High Road; Brent Cross; Charlie Brown's Roundabout; Euston Road; Lombard Roundabout; London Road Roundabout; Malden Rushett; Mill Hill Circus; Purley Cross Gyratory; Barking Riverside; Seven Sisters Road; Stoke Newington Gyratory; Thornton Heath Ponds; Trinity Road; Tulse Hill Gyratory and Victoria Circus.",
     "Funding for these schemes would be covered by the Transport for London (TfL) Business Plan and through third party contributions.",
     "One of the other key schemes to benefit is one of London's biggest regeneration projects - the redevelopment of the northern roundabout at Elephant and Castle.",
     "The radical plans, which will create 5,000 new homes and 4,000 jobs, will vastly improve the facilities for road users and local residents.",
     "Dedicated cycling facilities will also be created, with public consultation starting later this month and work beginning early next year.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe IMAX roundabout at Waterloo will also be redeveloped, creating better interchange facilities at Waterloo station as well as improved facilities for cyclists.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eToday also marks the completion of a major project to transform Euston Circus, one of London's biggest and busiest road junctions, unveiled today by TfL, Camden Council and developer, British Land.",
     "The overhaul, which will make the junction safer for cyclists and pedestrians as well as significantly increase space for urban realm, is the first major project in the capital to be delivered using the recommendations set out by the Mayor's Roads Task Force.",
     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: `Smarter design of our roads and public spaces, exemplified by our radical plans for Elephant \u0026 Castle, will play a key role in ensuring that London remains the best big city to live, work and invest.",
     "`We've been hard at work putting the bold and imaginative blueprint of the Road's Task Force into practice and we're now seeing the fruits of that labour at key locations across the capital.'\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTfL's Managing Director of Surface Transport, Leon Daniels, said: `The Roads Task Force was set up to deliver world-class streets and roads fit for the future to support London's population which is set to grow to 10 million people by 2031.",
     "`Balancing the needs of all users, we will be investing millions into transforming London's road network in the coming years, helping to keep the capital moving while creating new, inviting places to work, shop and relax.'\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThese improvements, made in partnership with London's boroughs, developers and businesses, will ensure the capital can cope with major population growth and remain one of the most economically productive, vibrant, accessible and attractive world cities.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBritish Land's Head of West End Asset Management, David Lockyer, said: `British Land wishes to thank TfL and Camden Council for its support and assistance in delivering this transformation of Euston Circus.",
     "`It demonstrates that even the most challenging of London environments can be tackled with a united and focused partnership.",
     "`The junction improvements are one of a number of key transport interventions funded by British Land in this area of Camden as part of its wider regeneration of Regent's Place.",
     "`The junction improvements provide benefits for all modes and especially for those cyclists and pedestrians accessing Regent's Place.",
     "`The Regent's Place campus has become one of Central London's most dynamic office, residential and leisure locations and is home to over 14,000 workers and residents.'",
     "Chair of London Councils' Transport and Environment Committee, Councillor Catherine West, said: `These schemes, developed in partnership with boroughs, developers, businesses, and Transport for London through the Mayor's Roads Task Force, should offer real benefits for local communities and road users.",
     "`They will better address the needs of all road users, including pedestrians, cyclists and motorists, and have a positive impact on the quality of life for residents.",
     "`We look forward to continuing our work with the Mayor's Roads Task Force to ensure these major projects are a success for Londoners.",
