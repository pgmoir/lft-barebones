     "We want to remind customers of the forthcoming work to the lifts and Covent Garden station and make them aware of the alternative travel options available to them",
     "Work on two of the four lifts will start from 24 February 2014 and will last for approximately ten months.",
     "The replacement work will require engineers to completely remove the existing lift cars as well as replace all of the structural, mechanical and electrical parts.",
     "Work to modify the steel structure work within the lift shaft is also required, adding to the complexity of the work.",
     "Work on the remaining two lifts will take place from February 2015.",
     "While the lifts are replaced Covent Garden station will be exit only and at weekends westbound Piccadilly line trains will not stop at the station.",
     "Customers will be able to use Leicester Square or Charing Cross stations, both of which are a short signposted walk away from Covent Garden.",
     "The replaced lifts will provide a 25 per cent increase in customer capacity by utilising larger lift cars and an increased running speed and they will be compliant with current lift and disability legislation.",
     "They will also be more energy efficient and contribute towards TfL's commitment to reduce its carbon footprint.",
     "Phil Hufton, Chief Operating Officer for London Underground, said:",
     "'We want to remind customers of the forthcoming work to the lifts and Covent Garden station and make them aware of the alternative travel options available to them.",
     "\"The station will be exit only and westbound Piccadilly trains will not stop at Covent Garden on weekends only.",
     "Customers will be able to use Leicester Square or Charing Cross stations, both of which are a short signposted walk away from Covent Garden.",
     "'We have explored various options to carry out these works while keeping disruption at a minimum for our customers.",
     "We apologise for the disruption to journeys this will cause but customers will experience the benefit of a quicker lift service with lift capacity increasing by 25 per cent.'",
     "The current lifts at Covent Garden station were installed around 25 years ago.",
     "The programme for replacing the lifts has been developed to reduce the impact on customers using the station.",
     "This means that total time to complete the work on all four lifts will be around 17 months rather than the standard 28 months."
