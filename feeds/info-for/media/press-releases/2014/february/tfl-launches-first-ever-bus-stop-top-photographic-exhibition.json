     "The Year of the Bus is a celebration of our extensive, accessible and world class bus service and this is one of many such collaborations throughout this year.",
     "The exhibition, entitled 'Bus Stops', features ten works by celebrated fashion photographer and artist Juergen Teller, that are displayed on bus stops along the Strand during London Fashion Week from 14th - 23rd February.",
     "The images feature well known faces from the fashion industry, such as Kate Moss, Yves Saint Laurent and Dame Vivienne Westwood as well as musicians Kurt Cobain and Bjork.  The works are displayed on the top of the bus shelters, giving passengers on the top deck of buses travelling down the Strand exclusive access.  This innovative idea enables passengers to enjoy art for free as they makes their everyday journeys on the bus network.",
     "Leon Daniels, TfL's Managing Director of Surface Transport, said: \"We are delighted to give our passengers exclusive access to works from celebrated photographer Juergen Teller during London Fashion Week.  The Year of the Bus is a celebration of our extensive, accessible and world class bus service and this is one of many such collaborations throughout this year.\"",
     "London's bus network - the most accessible and one of the most extensive anywhere in the world - has, throughout its history, played a central role in keeping the city moving and maintaining London's role as the engine-room of the UK economy.",
     "This year sees a number of important anniversaries, including 60 years since the creation of the original and iconic Routemaster, 75 years since the launch of its predecessor the RT-Type bus and 100 years since hundreds of London buses were sent to the Western Front to play a crucial role during the First World War.",
     "Throughout this year, Transport for London - working in partnership with London Transport Museum - will host a number of engaging events, exhibitions, recreations and other activities that will re-connect Londoners with their bus network and remind the world of the role that London buses, the bus drivers and the staff who support them, play in keeping London moving 24 hours a day 364 days of the  year.",
