     "LU proposed that rather than being remote from customers behind closed doors or glass windows, in future Tube station staff would not be based in ticket offices, but in ticket halls, on gate lines and on platforms, ready and available to give the best face-to-face service for customers.",
     "LU also made clear that any changes would be implemented without compulsory redundancies and that there would be a job for any member of staff who wants to remain at LU and is willing to be flexible.",
     "Since then, LU has called on all trade unions to engage with LU's proposals in genuine and meaningful consultation, to help shape the future of the Tube.",
     "Today's agreement at ACAS will see LU and trade unions enter a period of intensive discussion on LU's proposals and suspend further industrial action.",
     "The proposal made at ACAS includes the following commitments:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"That the unions will suspend this week's strike action;\",\"Two months of intensive talks, to examine LU's proposals in detail, during which time there will be no further industrial action; and,\",\"As was always intended as part of the formal consultation, a review, station by station, of LU's proposals which could result in some ticket offices remaining open.Â  We have always been prepared to listen to constructive proposals.\"]}",
