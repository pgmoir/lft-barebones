     "Transport for London (TfL) has today submitted plans to the London Borough of Croydon to redevelop and completely transform West Croydon Bus Station.",
     "The bus station, which is used by eight million passengers a year and sees 150 buses pass every hour, would be totally redeveloped as part of the proposed plans, complementing the London Borough of Croydon's urban realm improvements nearby.",
     "The plans submitted today focus on customer and passenger needs, with a significant improvement in the bus station environment - that will be made more light and airy with better customer information and fully accessible bus stops.",
     "Passenger safety will remain a priority, with the new station featuring modern CCTV coverage.",
     "The plans will effect a change in the way the buses use the station, removing operational inefficiencies currently caused by buses having to wait to pass through the bus station, it will also future-proof the station for the anticipated increase in passenger demand.",
     "This is especially important as it provides a convenient interchange for local London Overground and London Tramlink services, both of which are seeing increases in passenger usage since they were first introduced.",
     "There will be better provision for public transport staff and customers, including a retail unit planned for commercial let.",
     "All income generated by TfL would be reinvested in the transport network for the benefit of customers.",
     "Dana Skelley, TfL's Director of Asset Management, said: `We know what an important transport hub West Croydon Bus Station is to many local people.",
     "`Its importance is only going to grow as the London Borough of Croydon publishes it ambitious plans for the town.",
     "`Granting of planning permission for these proposed improvements would enable TfL to support Croydon's aspirations for south London and welcome passengers to one of the gateways to Croydon by the start of 2016.'",
