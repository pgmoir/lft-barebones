     "There was a visit from The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall, who met some of the apprentices who will construct and run the Underground of the future and they made their first Tube ride together on a train in passenger service running on the original stretch of the Metropolitan Railway Westbound from Farringdon station - the spiritual birthplace of the world's Metro railways.",
     "Mike Brown MVO, Managing Director of London Underground, said: `London Underground's 150th anniversary year has been truly extraordinary - reminding Londoners of the amazing engineering achievement of the pioneers who built the network and the enduring vital importance of the network to the London of today and the future.",
