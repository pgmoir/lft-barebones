     "This is another important step forward in our mission to make it easier for more people to get cycling in the capital",
     "Transport for London (TfL) has today announced that, following a successful trial, non-folding bicycles are now permitted on off-peak Docklands Light Railway (DLR) trains on a permanent basis.",
     "More than 5,000 cyclists travelled with their bikes on the DLR during a successful trial period that started in July 2013.",
     "The bike trial on the DLR is part of the Mayor's Vision for Cycling in London, the Â£913m plan to transform the Capital into a city where cycling is a key part of everyday life.",
     "Welcomed by cyclists and cycling campaign groups, allowing bikes on the DLR has opened up many new areas of London to cyclists.",
     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: `Opening up the Docklands Light Railway to cyclists will be a great boost to the cycling community and make it much more convenient for cyclists to cross the river.",
     "`This is another important step forward in our mission to make it easier for more people to get cycling in the capital.'",
     "DLR Director Rory O'Neill, said: `All cyclists are now welcome to use DLR services during off-peak hours and at all time on weekends and Bank Holidays.",
     "`This follows our successful six-month trial during which the London Cycling Campaign provided advice and assistance.",
     "`I'd like to thank them for their co-operation and input during the trial.'",
     "Serco Docklands Managing Director Kevin Thomas, said: `As DLR's operator we are delighted to have successfully introduced bicycles onto the railway as another improvement for DLR customers'.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLondon CC Chief Executive Ashok Sinha said: `We're delighted to have participated in the trial, and that Transport for London has agreed to allow off-peak cycles on the DLR permanently. This measure will open up new areas of the city to the many Londoners who ride bicycles and provide valuable cross-river links, encouraging more daily cycle journeys.'",
     "Cycling on London's main roads has risen by 173 per cent since 2001 and this plan will help double the level cycling over the next 10 years.",
     "To support this growth, the Mayor and TfL last year announced a range measures to achieve the many aspects of the Vision.",
     "A Central London cycling grid is currently being consulted on; it is a network of 60 miles of quieter routes to encourage less confident cyclists onto their bikes.",
     "An additional 80,000 cycle parking spaces will also be installed in residential locations, stations, workplaces and other trip destinations by 2016.",
     "Later this spring, innovative ideas by outer London boroughs will be rewarded when the Mayor announces the winner of his Mini-Holland fund to create cycling havens, delivering dramatic and transformational pro-cycling change.",
