     "We're committed to implement changes to station staffing without compulsory redundancies and we've been clear that there'll be a job for everyone at LU who wants to work for us and be flexible",
     "London Underground (LU) has urged TSSA union leaders to listen to their members and withdraw the threat of strike and industrial action, announced this afternoon.",
     "According to TSSA figures provided to LU, 932 members were balloted, with just 459 - or 49 per cent - voting.   Just 267 - or 29 per cent - of TSSA members balloted voted for strike action.",
     "The result means that over 70 per cent of TSSA members either voted no or did not vote for strike action.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis follows a similar pattern with the outcome of the RMT union's ballot last week when around 70 per cent of their membership either voted no or did not vote for strike action.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLU is consulting with trade unions and staff over its vision for the future of the Tube, set out in November of last year, which will improve the service for customers.",
     "This includes a new 24-hour 'Night Tube' service at weekends and more staff visible and available at stations to help customers buy the right ticket, plan their journeys and keep them safe and secure.",
     "As now, all Tube stations will continue to be staffed and controlled at all times that services are running.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe low turnout in the TSSA leadership's ballot reflects LU's clear commitments to staff, which have been outlined again to the unions repeatedly during sessions at the conciliation service ACAS.",
     "These include:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Every Tube station will be visibly staffed and controlled by LU staff\",\"There will be a job for everyone who wants to continue to be part of our organisation and who is ready to be flexible\",\"Any operational changes will be done without compulsory redundancies where we can collaborate to make change happen\",\"We will involve staff in any plans to grow, develop and change our services\",\"We will do this fairly and support people through change\"]}",
     "Despite these commitments, the TSSA leadership seem determined to press ahead with strike action that will lose their members 4 days' pay.",
     "This is also despite the TSSA's own Passenger Charter - outlining what it wants from London Underground - matching the commitments already set out by LU.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ePhil Hufton, LU's Chief Operating Officer, said: `Under our proposals all Tube stations will remain staffed and controlled at all times when services are operating, and we'll be introducing a 24-hour service at weekends during 2015.",
     "`In future, there will be more staff in ticket halls and on platforms to help customers buy the right ticket and keep them safe and secure.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e`We're committed to implement changes to station staffing without compulsory redundancies and we've been clear that there'll be a job for everyone at LU who wants to work for us and be flexible.",
     "`I re-affirm these commitments to the TSSA leadership, whose own Passenger Charter detailing what they want from us is identical to the commitments we have already set out, and I am urging them to abandon this completely unnecessary strike action and to proceed with the consultation that is underway without threatening to disrupt Londoners.'\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe trend of ticket sales away from ticket offices has surged over recent years and today less than three per cent of all Tube journeys involve a visit to a ticket office.",
     "In future, therefore, rather than being remote from customers behind closed doors or glass windows, more Tube station staff will be deployed to ticket halls, gate lines and platforms to give a better face-to-face service to customers and will be equipped with the latest mobile technology.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn 2015, weekend services will run through the night on core parts of the system - initially comprised of services on the Piccadilly, Victoria, Central, Jubilee and Northern lines.",
     "This network, which will be expanded to include other lines in subsequent years, will dovetail with existing 24-hour and Night Bus services to give our customers an extensive and integrated service throughout the night",
