     "London Overground has once again demonstrated the benefits of continued investment in improvements that our passengers tell us they want",
     "TfL's London Overground service has come out well ahead of the regional and national average for levels of passenger satisfaction in a survey conducted during the autumn.",
     "London Overground, which will take over some rail services to Liverpool Street next year, was given an 89 per cent overall satisfaction rating by passengers in the survey conducted by independent rail watchdog, Passenger Focus.",
     "This compares with 82 per cent for all operators in London and the South East and 83 per cent across the national network.",
     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: `London Overground is one of the most reliable and popular railways in the UK thanks to the huge investment we have made to give passengers what they want.",
     "`Next year even more of the capital will benefit with people in Enfield Town, Cheshunt (via Seven Sisters) and Chingford set to enjoy its first-rate service.",
     "We are also introducing five-car trains on the majority of routes in order to meet the rapidly increased demand.'",
     "TfL's Director of Rail, Jonathan Fox, said: `There is always room for improvement but London Overground has once again demonstrated the benefits of continued investment in improvements that our passengers tell us they want.",
     "`We look forward to bringing this approach to a new generation of passengers when London Overground arrives on services to Enfield Town, Cheshunt (via Seven Sisters) and Chingford in 2015.'",
     "The 89 per cent satisfaction rating comes just after London Overground came top of Network Rail's public performance measure table in December (despite adverse weather conditions), when 96.1 per cent of its trains ran on time. This compares with a national average of 83.7 per cent of trains running on time during the same period.",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"The National Rail Passenger Survey is conducted every spring and autumn by independent rail watchdog, Passenger Focus.
