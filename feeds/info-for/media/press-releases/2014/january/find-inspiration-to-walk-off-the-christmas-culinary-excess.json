     "Over the past year, Transport for London teamed up with a host of familiar faces who shared their favourite walks around the capital.",
     "So if you need any inspiration on where to take a pleasant winter stroll, then look no further than the Transport for London YouTube channel.",
     "Comedian Steve Furst, Olympic athletes Louise Hazel and Lawrence Clarke and Tyler James, finalist from BBC talent show The Voice are among the people featured on the \u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/19nebal\"\u003eWalking in London YouTube playlist\u003c/a\u003e .",
     "All celebrities featured in the walking films gave their time for free.",
     "Or, if you fancy taking on a more planned walk then help is at hand. TfL and Walk Unlimited (formerly Walk England) have established a network of routes, known as the Walk London network,Â covering more than 360 miles in total around the Capital.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Walking for leisure\"}",
     "Lilli Matson, Head of TfL Delivery Planning said: 'At this time of year, inevitably we are all thinking about resolutions for the new year.",
     "Walking for leisure is one of those great resolutions that it is really easy to keep - because you can incorporate it as part of your daily commute or enjoy an energising lunchtime wander.'",
     "Some of the highlights of the TfL/Walk Unlimited network include:\u003cbr /\u003eThe Capital Ring - At 78 miles long, this is a surprisingly green walking route that circles central London. It will take you through parks and open spaces.\u003cbr /\u003eThe Green Chain Walk - An extensive network providing many days of walking through woodland and open spaces.\u003cbr /\u003eThe Jubilee Greenway - A path for walkers and cyclists, linking the Olympic and Paralympic Games venues, with some of the capital's best attractions, heritage sites, parks, waterways and views.\u003cbr /\u003eJubilee Walkway - A route to celebrate the Queen's Silver Jubilee, encompassing many landmarks, from St Paul's to Buckingham Palace, with Bloomsbury and the City on the way.\u003cbr /\u003eLea Valley Walk - 18 miles of path following the river and canal in north east London. Highlights include the Swan and Pike Pool near Enfield Lock and two colourful marinas at Waltham Abbey and Springfield.\u003cbr /\u003eLondon Loop - This almost completely encircles Greater London and covers a distance of 152 miles.\u003cbr /\u003eThames Path - On this route you are likely to see boating in almost all its forms, including canoeing, sailing, trip boats, tugs, barges, narrowboats, houseboats, marinas and boatyards.",
     "Additionally, TfL is making many other improvements to help make London a city that is easier and more pleasurable to enjoy on foot.",
     "These include creating more public spaces and enhancing existing ones, and improving walking routes and pedestrian wayfinding.\u003cbr /\u003e"
