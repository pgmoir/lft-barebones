     "London Underground (LU) today issued travel advice to customers should strike action on the Northern line, threatened by the leadership of the RMT union, go ahead on Monday 1 December. The strike action has been called by the RMT leadership after one of its members was dismissed by LU after failing an alcohol breath test.",
     "Safety for customers using the network is LU's number one priority, which is why a zero tolerance policy towards alcohol at work is strictly adhered to. Anyone found to be in breach of this policy faces a disciplinary process and possible dismissal. LU's health and safety procedures are fully in line with medical standards and are representative of best practice in the rail industry.",
     "The RMT strike action is currently due to take place all day on Monday 1 December. If it does go ahead LU will try to run a good service on the Northern line but there may be some disruption. Other Tube services, the DLR, London Overground and National Rail will operate normally.",
     "Phil Hufton, London Underground's Chief Operating Officer, said: `The RMT has absolutely no basis to take strike action after one of their members was dismissed for failing an alcohol breath test.  To ensure the safety of our employees and customers we operate a zero-tolerance policy towards alcohol at work. At no point to date has the RMT leadership disputed our alcohol testing process, which is fully in line with medical standards and is representative of best practice in the rail industry.",
     "`I urge the RMT leadership to call off this pointless strike threat and to consider how to resolve this issue. Strike action is inappropriate and unnecessary and will not influence our decision over the failed alcohol test.'",
     "`Should Monday's strike go ahead my staff will work tirelessly to run a good service on the Northern line to help Londoners get to where they need to go. Station staff will also be available across the network to help customers with their journeys, and I would advise customers to check our website for the latest information. All other Tube, DLR and London Overground routes will operate as normal.'",
     "Customers are advised to check the TfL website for the latest Northern line service levels or to follow @TfLTravelAlerts and @northernline on Twitter."
