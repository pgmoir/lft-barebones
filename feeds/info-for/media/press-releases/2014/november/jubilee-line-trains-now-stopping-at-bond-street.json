     "Jubilee line customers heading to the West End to do their Christmas shopping will now be able to alight at Bond Street station from today (24 November), after works to connect the new ticket hall to the existing station infrastructure were completed ahead of schedule.",
     "Due to the complex nature of the new ticket hall work the escalators were inaccessible and Jubilee line trains were not able to stop at the station. The work has been completed early - meaning Jubilee and Central line trains are stopping at Bond Street again. Vital modernisation work is continuing at the station. Therefore passengers will only be able to exit or change lines at the station until mid-December. Passengers who usually start their journey at Bond Street are advised to use nearby Marble Arch station and change onto the Jubilee line at Bond Street if required.",
     "The redevelopment of Bond Street station is part of London Underground's (LU's) Â£10 billion programme of continuous improvements. Major construction work will modernise and enlarge the station by 2017, allowing for the expected increase from 155,000 to 225,000 daily passengers at the station when Crossrail arrives in 2018.",
     "New lifts will make the station step-free from street to platform, and new escalators are being fitted to handle the increasing number of customers who will be using the station.",
     "Major expansion working is also taking place at Tottenham Court Road station and from early next year passengers will get their first look at brand new parts of the station, when new access opens to the Northern line platforms. This includes a new entrance, with a second entrance opening later in 2015, a large part of the new ticket hall and escalators leading down to new pedestrian passages.",
     "David Waboso CBE, LU's Capital Programmes Director, said: `Bond Street station, at the heart of the West End, is already a major destination and passenger numbers will rise even further when Crossrail services begin. We're therefore transforming the Tube station - with a new ticket hall, new entrance and step-free access amongst other improvements.",
     "`Both Jubilee line and Central line trains are now stopping at the station as the work has been completed earlier than scheduled, due to the hard work and dedication of our engineers. Passengers are advised while the next stage of vital tunnelling work takes place that they will be able to change lines or exit Bond Street station and then from mid-December the station will be fully open to passengers. I apologise for the inconvenience that this will cause, but unfortunately it's impossible to do this work solely during the few engineering hours we have available when the Tube is closed. The end result will be a much bigger and better station for the hundreds of thousands of customers who use the station each day.'",
     "Steven Medway, Managing Director Trading Environment, New West End Company said: `Bond Street station is being transformed right under our feet and once completed will become a brand new entrance to the world's best shopping district. With the additional space created, journeys will become easier and quicker. From this December, when Christmas shopping will be in full swing, all lines will again stop at Bond Street for full access to the shops.'",
