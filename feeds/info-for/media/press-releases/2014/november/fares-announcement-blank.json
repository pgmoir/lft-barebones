     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, today set out a step change in\n        Transport for London's (TfL's) fares for 2015, giving flexible and part-time\n        workers, including those with unpredictable hours, access to lower fares.",
     "The new fares reflect modern-day travel patterns and deliver on a commitment by\n        the Mayor to the London Assembly to address the specific needs of part-time workers\n        in the capital.",
     "Overall, TfL fares will be frozen in real terms, with an\n        average increase of 2.5%.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Flexible and part-time travel\"}",
     "London's workforce has changed.  Twenty two per cent of\n        Londoners now work part-time, while many others have flexible working patterns\n        and do not know how many days or hours they will work each week.",
     "In response the Mayor is cutting pay as you go daily caps\n        dramatically so they become one fifth of the cost of a 7 Day Travelcard to Zone\n        1. This produces a much fairer commuting cost for many part-time workers\n        and will mean that those with unpredictable working patterns can simply use pay\n        as you go Oyster or contactless payments with the new guarantee that they will\n        pay no more in a day than one fifth of the cost of a 7 day Travelcard ticket.\n        Bringing daily caps in line with the cost of monthly and annual tickets would\n        cost more than £200m per year.",
     "Daily fares\n        capping allows customers using Oyster or contactless payments to make as many\n        journeys as they need to in a single day, but caps the amount they pay for\n        their travel at a set level. Once the total of all the fares reaches a certain\n        amount the customer will not have to pay any more for their journeys for the\n        rest of the day.",
     "The all-day cap\n        for Zones 1-2 will be cut by £2.00 from £8.40 to £6.40; and for Zones 1-6 by\n        over £4.00 from £15.80 to £11.70. This means that part-time workers using pay\n        as you go will pay similar daily rates as full time commuters using a 7 day\n        Travelcard. As an example, for someone who uses a Zone 1-2 7 day Travelcard\n        (£32.10 in 2015) to travel 5 days a week, their travel will cost £6.42 each day\n        - similar to the new £6.40 pay as you go daily cap for those who travel less\n        frequently.",
     "The potential\n        savings will be considerable, ranging from £200 to over £600 per year. When a 3\n        days a week customer travels between Zones 1-5 in 2015 they will pay a maximum\n        of £10.90 a day, rather than the current maximum of £15.80, saving £4.90 a day,\n        or £14.70 a week.  Over a year (for example 45 weeks) the savings are over\n        £600.",
     "The Mayor of\n        London, Boris Johnson, said: `This fares package delivers on my commitment to\n        address the needs of flexible and part time workers. By overhauling our fares\n        structure we will put money back into the pockets of hundreds of thousands of\n        hardworking people who make such a vital contribution to London's economy.\n        Freezing overall fares in real terms for next year allows us to hold down the\n        cost of travel, while maintaining our vital programme of modernisation. This will\n        ensure that the capital remains a competitive global city and a fantastic place\n        to live.`",

It will also be available at London\nUnderground, National Rail stations and Heathrow Airport to benefit people\narriving at Heathrow outside Tube operational hours.",
     "The pay as you\ngo single bus fare will increase by 5p to £1.50 but the daily 'bus travel only'\ncap will be frozen at £4.40.  This means that someone making three bus\ntrips a day will see their fares increase by only 5p from £4.35 (= £1.45 x 3)\nto the new cap of £4.40.

These application fees have not been increased since 2011.",
     "More than 85\nmillion Oyster cards have now been issued.  Nearly one million cards are\nissued every month and nearly a quarter are returned for a refund.  Many\nof these returned cards were only issued a few days beforehand.  To\nencourage customers to keep their card and reduce costs associated with\nproviding and issuing cards, those who return a card within a month of purchase\nwill pay an early return charge of £3.00 from their £5 deposit.",
     "TfL does not\nmake a profit from fares - every penny is invested in delivering and improving\ntransport. As well as meeting the needs of the modern London workforce this\nfares package will ensure that the unprecedented investment in London's\ntransport network will continue. The current investment programme includes\nupgrades to the Tube, rail and road networks and the delivery of Crossrail.
