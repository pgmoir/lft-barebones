     "London Underground today unveiled £1million of improvements to its training facility for apprentices at their Skills and Training Centre in Acton, as it continues to support future generations of transport workers.",
     "The Skills and Training Centre is home to London Underground Engineering apprentices and has been modernised with new equipment and first class facilities to help ensure they have the skills needed to support the capital's transport network. Apprentices at the Centre are in roles including Signalling, Rolling Stock and Track Engineering.",
     "There is a skills shortage in the transport industry, particularly in engineering and London Underground is investing in the equipment and infrastructure its apprentices use while learning the trade to ensure they have the skills they will need to keep London moving. The reopening of the Centre came during \"Tomorrow's Engineers Week\" (3-7 November), which aims to encourage more young people to consider a career in engineering.",
     "In September 2014, TfL welcomed 86 new apprentices in a variety of roles ranging from Project Planning to Highway Technicians. It has also created over 100 new apprenticeship roles for 2015. The apprenticeship roles will be available for applications on the TfL website from February 2015.",
     "Mike Brown MVO, Managing Director of London Underground and London Rail, said:",
     "'All our apprentices are helping us to support over 30 million journeys every day as we continue to invest billions of pounds in our transport network to meet the needs of London's growing population to support jobs, homes and economic growth. It is clearly essential that we have the right people with the right skills to enable us to deliver for the city and its people.",
     "'The infrastructure that apprentices use during their training is vital if they are to be equipped with the necessary skills to do the job. Tomorrow's Engineers Week is a great opportunity to encourage more young people to consider engineering as a career option.'",
     "With London's population set to grow from 8.4m today to 10m by 2030, it is vital that London has a transport network capable of keeping the city working and growing and making life in the capital better. A team of dedicated and highly qualified staff is essential to delivering that.",
     "Katharine Palmer, an Advanced Civil Engineering Apprentice at TfL, said:",
     "'I've always been interested in maths, physics and architecture which led me to the TfL apprentice scheme, which is widely recognised as one of the best in the field. I've been in the role for two years and found it to be very interesting and challenging; I've learned a lot and look forward to joining TfL as a certified engineer. I'm also delighted by the fact that talented women are now seeing engineering as an exciting and rewarding industry.'",
     "Since April 2009, TfL and its suppliers have created over 5,000 apprenticeship roles, supporting the Mayor of London's campaign to create 250,000 apprenticeship roles by 2016.  While many of the apprentices are in London, many are employed across the UK as a direct result of TfL contracts with other business. In addition, Crossrail and its contractors will also deliver a legacy of 400 apprenticeships with more than 283 apprentices already working on the project.",
     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said:",
     "'As our city grows, the need for top-notch transport and infrastructure grows with it.  That is why getting our young people equipped with the skills to keep London moving is of paramount importance. I am determined to continue increasing the number of apprenticeships in the capital and have committed more than £2.5m in schemes over the last two years, with more funding secured for next year. I urge all London's firms to follow TfL's lead and employ an apprentice.'",
     "All apprentices living in London aged 18 or over and in their first year of an approved apprenticeship course can save 30 per cent against the price of adult rate Travelcards and Bus \u0026 Tram Passes with an Apprentice Oyster photocard available via the TfL website.",
     "TfL has an award winning Supplier Skills Team who work with the business and its suppliers to generate apprentice and employment opportunities. These opportunities are aligned to the skills requirements of TfL and its supply chain and provide the opportunity to source new talent into the industry whilst working to address skills shortages. To date almost 100 suppliers have engaged with the SST to deliver apprenticeships.",
