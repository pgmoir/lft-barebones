     "As part of the activities to mark the\n        Year of the Bus, Transport for London (TfL) and The Philosophy Foundation are\n        joining forces next week (Thursday 20 November) to celebrate UNESCO's World\n        Philosophy Day with a series of philosophical enquiries aboard one of London's\n        iconic New Routemaster buses.",
     "The Philosophy Bus will be stopping at\n        four locations on Thursday 20 November and running the following philosophical\n        enquiries at each stop:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"10:15\\n            - 11:15 London Transport Museum (Covent Garden) - Environmental Ethics\\n            The environment is\\n            forefront in a lot of people's minds these days. What exactly is nature, what\\n            makes something natural or un-natural? How far should we go to protect nature?\\n            The enquiry will be joined by Justin Rowlatt, the BBC's Ethical Man;\\n            ·\",\"11:45\\n            - 12:45 River Thames (Embankment) - Metaphysics\\n            Angie Hobbs, Professor\\n            of the Public Understanding of Philosophy at Sheffield University will lead a\\n            discussion on the nature of change and identity.  Given that the water\\n            constantly flows, is the Thames the same river it was a week ago?  Can you\\n            step into the same river twice? Can you step into the same river once?\",\"13:45\\n            - 14:45 Tate Britain - Aesthetics\\n            What is beauty?  Is\\n            it in our mind, or in the object itself?

Grayling will be giving a talk and taking a Q\\u0026A session.\"]}",
     "Leon Daniels, TfL's Managing Director\n        of Surface Transport, said: `Many great philosophical debates can be heard\n        every day on board London's buses as they travel across the capital. This\n        unique and free event is an opportunity to bring people together - aboard an\n        iconic London bus - to discuss some of the questions that great philosophical\n        minds have mulled over for centuries.`",
     "Peter Worley, CEO and co-founder of\n        The Philosophy Foundation, said: `Thinking skills developed through\n        philosophy are foundational to learning - by doing philosophy regularly\n        children develop good thinking habits, learn how to communicate their ideas\n        effectively and listen with a critical, but open mind.`",
     "UNESCO's World Philosophy Day is a\n        celebration of philosophy, and of its importance in education. Every World\n        Philosophy Day the Philosophy Foundation brings philosophy to a wider audience\n        and involves young people from their schools giving them a new experience of\n        philosophy, and broadening their horizons.",
     "At each location the upper deck will\n        be allotted for discussions between young people, aged between seven and\n        twelve, whilst the lower decks will be for everyone else. Peter Worley will be\n        running sessions for young children on the top deck and the bottom deck\n        sessions will be run by a Philosophy Foundation Specialist philosophy teacher,\n        or by a special guest.

     "Events and activities are\n        being held throughout 2014 to celebrate TfL's Year of the Bus, in partnership\n        with London Transport Museum and the capital's bus operators - specifically the\n        role that London buses, bus drivers and the staff who support them play in\n        keeping the capital moving.\n         \n        The Year of the Bus marks a\n        number of important anniversaries including 60 years since the creation of the\n        original and iconic Routemaster, 75 years since the launch of its predecessor\n        the RT-type bus, and 100 years since hundreds of London buses were sent to the\n        Western Front to play a crucial role during the First World War.",
     "Other Year of the Bus\n        partnerships have included a unique collaboration with the world-famous Fender\n        Stratocaster guitar - also celebrating its 60th anniversary this\n        year; the installation of an operational bus stop and shelter on Regent Street\n        made entirely out of LEGO and a special Routemaster Google Doodle on the\n        Google.co.uk homepage.",
     "The Year of the Bus has also seen the first ever\n        series of live music performances on board a New Routemaster bus as part of\n        Oxjam, and 'bus stop top' exhibitions along the Strand from renowned\n        photographers Juergen Teller and David LaChapelle.",
     "Visitors taking part in the second\n        enquiry can get inspiration from the river and take a ride on TfL's River Bus\n        services from Embankment Pier.",
     "By putting understanding\n        back at the heart of education, The Philosophy Foundation works to develop\n        children's autonomous learning and higher-order thinking skills, equipping them\n        for the kind of life-long learning and thinking that are essential in the 21st\n        Century.",
     "Its focus is on working in schools with a high proportion of\n        disadvantaged pupils to re-enfranchise those that find themselves outside or at\n        the peripheries of education and democratic society.\n        The Foundation is unique in\n        training Philosophy graduates to bring philosophy into schools from nursery up\n        to 18 using a method of guided conversation that has been devised by co-founder\n        and CEO Peter Worley, inspired by philosophical method.",
     "The Foundation\n        also trains teachers in the transferable skills of Philosophy: thinking skills,\n        questioning and enquiry.\n        A\n        philosophical enquiry is not a lecture or a talk, but an opportunity for\n        attendees to think together around a topic: to think critically, creatively,\n        to play with ideas and thoughts collaboratively. It is facilitated by a\n        philosopher, whose job it is to keep the conversation philosophical, and\n        perhaps introduce the group\n        to ideas from the philosophical canon, depending on where the conversation\n        goes.",
