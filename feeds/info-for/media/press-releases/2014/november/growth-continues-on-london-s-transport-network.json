     "The number of journeys on London's transport network is continuing\n        to break records Transport for London (TfL) announced today, with 76.1 million\n        passenger journeys on London Underground and London Buses combined during the\n        week of 22 September - the highest ever level.",
     "London Underground saw 26.1\n        million passenger journeys, while London Buses carried 50 million passenger\n        journeys - the largest number ever for buses.",
     "Last year's combined Tube and bus record of 75.8 million journeys was set\n        during the week of 9 December, which traditionally sees higher passenger\n        numbers as London gears up for Christmas, and new highs are expected to be\n        reached this coming December.\n        London's population continues to grow faster than any other European\n        city.",
     "The population is expected to grow from 8.4 million today to reach\n        10 million by 2030. Demand for public transport is predicted to increase by 60% on the Underground and 80% on the national rail network by 2050,\n        compared to current levels.",
     "TfL is delivering sustained investment across Tube and bus services to meet this\n        growing demand.",
     "The bus service is now one of the most extensive anywhere\n        in the world, and more buses, new routes, and more late night services have\n        been added.",
     "Redevelopment work to increase capacity at key Tube stations and\n        make them step-free is underway at Victoria, Tottenham Court Road and Bond\n        Street, and more frequent services have recently been introduced on the\n        Victoria and Jubilee lines.",
     "The first phase of the modernisation of the\n        Northern line will be completed soon - increasing capacity by 20% and\n        capacity has also been increased on London Overground and the DLR.\n         \n        If service levels are to meet future demand and ensure that the\n        network can continue to support new jobs and growth, sustainable investment\n        must be guaranteed.",
     "Consultations are currently underway on proposals to extend\n        the Bakerloo line and extending London Overground to Old Oak Common and Barking\n        riverside. After Crossrail, operated by TfL, enters service from 2018, London's\n        economy and population will already need Crossrail 2.",
     "Sir Peter Hendy CBE, London's Transport Commissioner, said: 'Thanks to vital investment and a programme of modernisation we've seen delays\n        cut and more frequent and reliable trains and buses. However, we have to keep\n        looking towards the future, and continue the investment, to ensure our\n        transport network keeps pace with the growing number of people who need it.\n        Only through this can the network continue to be a driver of the UK's\n        economy, and maintain London's position as a world-leading city.'",
     "TfL is making widespread improvements to the network while continuing to\n        deliver huge savings. The £16bn savings and efficiencies programme to 2020/21\n        has secured savings of up to £12bn.  This programme is central to helping\n        to meet the challenge of operating one of the worlds oldest and most extensive\n        transport networks while, at the same time, upgrading and modernising it to\n        accommodate London's rapid growth.",
     "The week of 9 December 2013 saw 27.2 million Tube journeys and\n        48.6 million bus journeys.",
     "From 12 September next year, London Underground will introduce the\n        'Night Tube' - an all night 24 hour services on key lines on Friday and\n        Saturday nights, which will cut journey times, support the creation of some\n        2000 new jobs and boost London's economy by £360 million.",
     "During next year, London Underground will be modernising the way\n        customers are served at stations, with staff brought out from underused ticket\n        offices and back offices to where they can assist customers most effectively -\n        in ticket halls, at gate lines and on platforms. There will be more staff\n        visible and available to help customers to buy the right ticket or use\n        contactless payments,  plan their journeys and keep them safe and secure,\n        and all stations will be staffed at all times."
