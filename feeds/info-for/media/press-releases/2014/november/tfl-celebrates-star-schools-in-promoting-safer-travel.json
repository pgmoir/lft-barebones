     "Transport\n        for London (TfL) has today celebrated the achievements of over a thousand\n        schools across London in promoting active and safer travel at an event at City\n        Hall, as part of TfL's STARS (Sustainable Travel: Active, Responsible, Safe)\n        schools initiative.",
     "Almost\n        half of London schools are now accredited to TfL's STARS programme, which\n        launched in 2007 to encourage children, parents and teachers to adopt more\n        sustainable and safe ways of travelling to school. This equates to 1,385\n        primary and secondary schools across the capital, up 11% from 2013.",
     "Schools are judged on the number of initiatives delivered and their success in\n        changing travel behaviour with Bronze, Silver and Gold accreditation levels.\n        The\n        highest performing schools across London attended the annual event at City\n        Hall, which recognised achievements in reducing car use, increasing walking and\n        cycling and using public transport more responsibly. Awards were presented for\n        the best primary and secondary school in North, South, East and West London,\n        schools of excellence (in different travel areas) and a special recognition\n        award.",

     "Leon\n        Daniels, Managing Director of TfL Surface Transport, said: `We are committed to\n        making travel in London an enjoyable, healthy and safe experience for young\n        people.  The work being accomplished by STARS accredited schools and\n        particularly London's Gold performing schools are inspirational examples of\n        what can be achieved to promote safer and active travel choices. We hope that\n        by celebrating their achievements we will encourage all London children to\n        travel safely, actively and responsibly to school.`",
     "At\n        six regional events held across London last month, all STARS accredited schools\n        received Bronze, Silver and Gold grading for their initiatives.",
     "They also\n        pledged to increase their activities and nine regional school travel plan\n        champions were recognised for outstanding individual results.",
     "Since\n        2007, STARS accredited schools have achieved an 8% reduction in car\n        use as part of the school journey, with Silver and Gold schools achieving the\n        greatest success in increasing walking and cycling to school.\n        New\n        for 2014, STARS allows schools to capture all of their accreditation activity\n        through an easy-to-use online portal as part of the TfL website.  This is\n        part of TfL's efforts to make it easier for schools to focus on delivery, while\n        capturing evidence of their initiatives. TfL's work will continue to drive\n        efficiencies and enhancements for schools promoting safer and active travel\n        across London.",
     "Earlier\n        this year TfL also launched a Delivery Plan for Schools and Young People, which\n        outlines its priorities for people aged 25 and under in the capital.  The\n        plan brings together all the programmes, projects and activities available to\n        schools and young people and highlights the importance of this stakeholder\n        group to TfL.
