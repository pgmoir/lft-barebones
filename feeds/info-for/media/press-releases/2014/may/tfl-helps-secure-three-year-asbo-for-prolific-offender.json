     "Strong collaboration between\n        London Underground's (LU's) Network Enforcement Department and the British\n        Transport Police has resulted in a three year anti-social behaviour order\n        (ASBO) against a prolific offender who repeatedly fare evaded and caused\n        harassment, alarm and distress to staff at Gants Hill station throughout 2013.",
     "Naimul Hoque,  aged 21,\n        from Ilford, was sentenced at Snaresbrook Crown Court, on Wednesday 23 April,\n        to 11 months jail for affray and assault on a Police Constable and given a\n        further one-month jail term for common assault and fare evasion.",
     "These\n        sentences were suspended for 18 months and he was given a six-month curfew\n        order - between 8pm and 6am - and ordered to undergo supervised treatment for\n        alcohol. He was also given a three-year ASBO, banning him from all London\n        Underground stations unless he is in possession of a valid ticket.",
     "The ASBO\n        also bans him from all LU stations when he is under the influence of alcohol.",
     "Hoque was arrested on\n        Thursday 5 September 2013, after he entered Gants Hill station and approached a\n        Customer Service Adviser at the gate-line, who had his back turned at the time.",
     "Hoque then viciously poked the member of staff inthe back before pushing\n        through the ticket gates to go down to the platforms.",
     "The matter was reported\n        to the British Transport Police and Hoque pleaded guilty to common assault and\n        fare evasion at Romford Magistrates' Court in December.",
     "He was later sentenced\n        for these offences and for entirely separate offences of affray and assault on\n        a police constable, at Snaresbrook Crown Court.",
     "Hoque caused such a nuisance\n        at Gants Hill station during 2013 that LU's enforcement team gathered 91\n        separate statements from LU staff witnesses about his behaviour.",
     "These\n        statements were then passed on to the British Transport Police to enable them\n        to secure the ASBO.",
     "Aidan Harris, London\n        Underground Manager of the Workplace Violence Unit, said:",
     "\"We will not tolerate\n        any form of abuse against our staff who have the right to carry out their work\n        duties without fear. Hoque was a constant threat to our staff, exposing them to\n        over nine-months of abuse. We welcome the result of his sentencing and hope\n        this sends out a clear message that we will continue to work closely with our\n        policing partners to provide a safe working environment for staff and our\n        customers.\"",
     "TfL will be re-launching\n        their marketing poster campaign on workplace violence and the damage it can\n        cause across the transport network this month. This will focus on reducing\n        abuse to staff by encouraging customers to think more about some of their\n        behaviours.",
