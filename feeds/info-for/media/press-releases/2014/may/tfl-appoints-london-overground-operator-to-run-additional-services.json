     "Transport\n        for London (TfL) has agreed to appoint LOROL, the London Overground train\n        operator, on an interim basis to run local services out of Liverpool Street\n        Station to north east London and improve standards for passengers.",
     "LOROL\n        (London Overground Rail Operations Ltd) will run the services - currently\n        managed under the Greater Anglia franchise - between Liverpool Street and\n        Enfield Town, Cheshunt (via Seven Sisters) and Chingford as well as those on\n        the Romford to Upminster line for 17 months starting on 31 May next year.",
     "The\n        London Overground concession, including these latest additions, will then be\n        re-let following an established bidding process.",
     "Under\n        TfL, and from day one of the transfer, passengers can look forward to seeing\n        staff at all London Overground -managed stations while trains are running.",
     "Their presence will bring immediate improvements to station security, safety\n        and accessibility. Oyster will continue to be available to passengers who will\n        also be able to use contactless payment cards for the same PAYG fare.",
     "They will\n        be able to take advantage of TfL's extensive multi-media travel service information.",
     "In a\n        rolling programme, all of the stations will be thoroughly cleaned, and have\n        new, modern ticket machines installed.",
     "The trains will also be fully cleaned\n        but TfL has ordered new ones which will carry more people more reliably than\n        before.",
     "LOROL has\n        operated London Overground for TfL, since 2007.",
     "During that time the network\n        has been significantly extended, carrying more people than ever, and it has\n        become one of the most punctual  railways in the UK.",
     "The\n        Director of London Rail, Jonathan Fox, who leads TfL's mainline rail business\n        said: \"London Overground is coming to West Anglia and will bring more staff,\n        simpler ticketing and, eventually, brand new trains to these lines. LOROL\n        has a proven record on delivery and I'm pleased that this will now extend to\n        West Anglia.\"",
     "LOROL\n        will take over the new routes on 31 May 2015 and run them until November 2016\n        when the current London Overground concession is due to end.",
