     "Customers\n        and City organisations will get another opportunity to have their say on\n        Transport for London's (TfL's) construction proposals for a major upgrade of\n        Bank station from next week when an online public consultation begins supported\n        by an exhibition on 12 \u0026 13 June.",
     "TfL\n        is proposing to substantially upgrade the capacity of Bank station from 2016.",
     "This will provide more space to get on and off Northern line trains,\n        quicker interchange, and improved accessibility.",
     "The\n        Bank/Monument station complex, located in the heart of the City of London's\n        financial district, is the fourth busiest interchange station on the\n        Underground network with 98 million customers using the station in 2012/13.",
     "This is set to increase in the coming years, so TfL is planning a major upgrade\n        of the six-line interchange which will increase capacity and provide a\n        step-free route between the Northern line platforms, Docklands Light Railway\n        and street levels.",
     "This summer TfL will be applying for a Transport \u0026 Works Act Order, which\n        if granted will give permission to do the work. Before this, TfL is holding\n        another public consultation.",
     "Feedback from\n        this will add to what has been learnt from previous consultations.",
     "Since\n        the last consultation in October 2013, TfL have further developed the plans,\n        and would like to hear views on:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"How the scheme will be built, including\\n            construction logistics\",\"Construction effects, including management of\\n            any noise, vibration and ground settlement\",\"Impacts of a temporary closure of the\\n            Northern line City branch in Spring 2020\"]}",
     "The\n        consultation will run from 2 June until 6 July 2014.",
     "Please visit www.tfl.gov.uk/bank-consultation and\n        tell us what you think.",
     "TfL\n        will also be holding a public exhibition on 12 and 13 June from 11am until 6pm\n        at St Mary Abchurch, Abchurch Lane EC4N 7BA (off Cannon St and King William\n        St).",
     "TfL has sought to maximise the scheme's\n        benefits to customers while reducing costs by taking a new approach to\n        procurement (\"innovative contractor engagement\") that rewards innovation\n        throughout the supply chain. Adopting this method on the Bank project has\n        delivered 45 per cent additional value through cost savings and improved\n        benefits.",
     "This has reduced the estimated final cost of the project by £61m and\n        cut planned engineering closures by more than 22 per cent.",
     "David\n        Waboso, London Underground's Capital Programmes Director, said: \"Bank is a key\n        interchange for our customers and it's vital that we keep pace with the\n        increase in demand we're seeing now and in the future. We've adopted a new\n        innovative approach to developing the Bank proposals which has allowed us to\n        incorporate innovations through market competition. Now we are giving our\n        customers another opportunity to give their views on our construction plans to\n        create a modern Tube interchange that will result in quicker and easier\n        journeys.\"",
     "The upgrade of the station\n        is planned to be delivered in 2021.",
     "The improvements are part of the\n        continuing modernisation of the Underground, with major stations, trains, track\n        and signalling being upgraded to provide more capacity for a growing city. LU's\n        plans to improve customer service will also see the public areas of stations -\n        ticket halls, ticket gates and platforms - become personalised customer service\n        centres, replicating the standards of service offered during the London 2012\n        Games.",
     "The\n        exhibition will include a three-dimensional model of the planned improvements,\n        an architect's animated film and displays showing greater detail of various\n        aspects of the plans.",
     "TfL staff will be on hand at the public exhibition to\n        explain more about the plans and answer questions.",
     "All views expressed through the consultation will be taken into account in\n        progressing the scheme, and a summary of consultation responses will be\n        published on line \u003ca href=\"https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e ",
