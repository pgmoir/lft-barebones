     "Laura Mvula, Omar MBE and more perform\n        exclusive sets on a bus\n         \n        As\n        part of the celebrations for Year of the Bus, Transport for London has teamed\n        up with Oxjam to bring lucky competition winners a money can't buy prize to see\n        the first ever series of live music performances on board a New Routemaster\n        bus.",
     "The set of shows  titled 'Bus Jam' will see an iconic New Routemaster bus\n        travel across London on Sunday 18 May, stopping at three different locations\n        where fortunate fans will board the bus to see exclusive, intimate performances\n        by their favourite artists.",
     "Artists performing include multi award winning Laura Mvula, acclaimed British\n        soul star Omar MBE, and many more familiar faces.",
     "This innovative idea is\n        the first time that TfL has teamed up with Oxfam, and will help raise awareness\n        about Oxjam - a month long music festival raising money for the charity.",
     "The\n        aim is to inspire music lovers across the country to get involved and put on\n        gigs in their communities this October. Oxjam festival is made up of hundreds\n        of music events taking place all across the UK, organised by volunteers who\n        know and love their local music scenes and with all money raised supporting\n        Oxfam's work worldwide.",
     "Leon\n        Daniels, TfL's Managing Director of Surface Transport, said: \"We are delighted\n        to give lucky passengers intimate, live performances of their favourite artists\n        on board our buses this Sunday.  This is one of many exciting\n        collaborations happening throughout this year that celebrate our extensive,\n        accessible and world class bus service.\"",
     "Throughout this year, The Year of the Bus, Transport for London -\n        working in partnership with the London Transport Museum - will host a number of\n        engaging events, exhibitions, recreations and other activities that will\n        re-connect Londoners with their bus network and remind the world of the role\n        that London buses, the bus drivers and the staff who support them, play in\n        keeping London moving 24 hours a day throughout the year."
