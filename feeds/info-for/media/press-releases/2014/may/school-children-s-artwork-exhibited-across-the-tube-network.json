     "Vickie Parker, Head of Art Dept at The Heathlands School, Hounslow, said:",
     "'It is cool that they are all a part of Art on the Underground now. Seeing the artwork here today brings back the whole experience for the students. We do so much preliminary study at school, it is nice for them to take this process one step further - to see how their artwork could look displayed in public.'",
     "Roger Carpenter, London Underground's Group Station Manger for Heathrow, said:",
     "'It is great to see this link between the station and local community. It is one of the things we are trying to do more of. It is especially good to be involved in one of the great projects of Art on the Underground - they are everywhere now.'",
