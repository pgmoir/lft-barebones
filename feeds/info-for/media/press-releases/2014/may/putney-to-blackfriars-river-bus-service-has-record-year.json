     "New\n        figures reveal that the Putney to Blackfriars River Bus service (route RB6) has\n        carried a record number of passengers since KPMG Thames Clippers took over operation\n        of the route in April 2013.",
     "The\n        enhanced River Bus service saw passenger numbers rise from 40,411 in 2012/13 to\n        a record 121,667 passenger journeys in 2013/14 - an increase of more than 200\n        per cent.",
     "During\n        the past year, Transport for London (TfL) and Thames Clippers have sought to\n        deliver increased passenger convenience with faster journey times and more\n        frequent services.",
     "The route now operates two thirds more services on\n        weekdays on modern, accessible, high speed catamarans all offering passengers a\n        guaranteed seat, free Wi-Fi  and the availability of onboard refreshments\n        for added comfort and convenience.",
     "Andy\n        Thompson, Head of London River Services, said: \"The Putney to Blackfriars River\n        Bus service goes from strength to strength, with more and more passengers\n        appreciating what a great way it is to travel.",
     "These modern boats offer\n        the latest passenger comforts, and with more departures than ever before we're\n        helping passengers make the most of the river.\"",
     "Oyster\n        is accepted as a method of payment on all River Bus services, including this\n        route, which means passengers can use Pay as You Go to pay for their\n        ticket.",
     "There is also a reduced fare for passengers with a valid\n        Travelcard.  For regular passengers there is a range of season tickets available\n        on a weekly, monthly and annual basis.",
     "TfL and the Mayor of London are committed to making the most of\n        passenger services on the River Thames and last year launched the 'River Action\n        Plan', which was a commitment to investing £10m in order to meet the ambitious\n        aim of increasing the number of people travelling on the river to 12 million a\n        year by 2020.",
     "This plan is already delivering as passenger numbers increased\n        from 6.5m to 8.4m last year.",
     "In addition to the availability of real time\n        next boat information at River Bus piers, work is progressing well for improved\n        passenger information, enabling better integration of river services with other\n        transport services in the capital.",
     "Looking ahead, work to increase passenger and berthing capacity at three\n        key piers, Bankside, Embankment and Westminster, is well on the way to\n        be completed during 2015 to help meet increased demand for services.",
     "A\n        number of new pier infrastructure projects are also progressing well as new\n        riverside developers move forward with their plans.",
     "These include new piers at\n        Battersea Power Station and Plantation Wharf, which are due to open early next\n        year.",
     "Plans for piers at Convoys Wharf in Deptford, Enderby Wharf in Greenwich\n        and the western side of North Greenwich Peninsula are also underway.",
