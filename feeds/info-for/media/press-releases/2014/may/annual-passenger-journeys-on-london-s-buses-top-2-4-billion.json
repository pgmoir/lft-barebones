     "London's bus network carried more\n        passengers in 2013/14 than in any year since 1959, with over 2.4 billion\n        journeys made.",
     "In addition, Tuesday 29 April saw the highest number of\n        buses operating on the capital's roads since 1953 with a record 7,961 buses -\n        266 more than usual.",
     "Half of all the bus journeys made\n        in England each year take place in London and the capital's buses travelled 491\n        million kilometres in passenger service in 2013/14.",
     "Bus ridership grew by\n        69 per cent between 1999/00 and 2013/14 and the number of bus kilometres\n        operated increased by 41 per cent.",
     "The continued population growth in the\n        capital is expected to see usage of London's buses increase by around seven per\n        cent by 2020/21.",
     "Responding today to the London\n        Assembly Transport Committee's report 'Bus Services in London', published in\n        October 2013, Transport for London (TfL) welcomed the Assembly's recognition of\n        the capital's bus network as 'world class' and has committed to:",

Four fifths of the\\n            capital's bus services operate on borough roads\",\"Further increase transparency by publishing\\n            annually the number of passenger journeys and bus kilometres operated on each\\n            of nearly 700 bus routes, with data for 2013/14 published by the end of this\\n            year\"]}",
     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson,\n        said:  \"Buses play a massively important role in keeping London moving,\n        ferrying huge numbers of people around every far corner of the capital.  Without the efficient movement of people that our network allows, London simply\n        wouldn't function as smoothly it does.  As we celebrate the 'Year of the\n        Bus', we remain fully focused on maintaining our position as a world-leader in\n        bus services, while ensuring that the network adapts and continues to support\n        the growth of our great city.\"",
     "Leon Daniels, Managing Director for\n        TfL Surface Transport, said: \"The London Assembly rightly recognises London's\n        bus network as world class, with it ranked top for size, frequency, reliability\n        and accessibility when compared to other world cities including Paris and New\n        York.\n          We\n        are committed to maintaining and further improving the bus network to maintain\n        this world class service and meet the needs of London's growing\n        population.  To this end, we will introduce improvements such as\n        strengthening our engagement with the boroughs to better target our investment\n        in bus services and publish more detailed data on how the network is\n        performing. Critically, we need the Government to continue to support our\n        investment while we work hard to get the most out of the existing network and\n        match capacity to passenger demand.\"",
