     "Bus journeys between Peckham and\n        Elephant \u0026 Castle are being made easier from Saturday 10 May, as Transport\n        for London (TfL) extends bus route 136 to provide customers with additional\n        capacity.",
     "Route 136, which currently runs between Grove Park and Peckham,\n        will be extended to Elephant \u0026 Castle taking the same route as the 343 bus\n        service.",
     "This will mean increased capacity in the North Peckham and Aylesbury\n        Estate areas.",
     "More buses will be added to route\n        136 to maintain the frequency of service - which is a bus every 10 minutes Monday to Saturday daytimes and\n        every 15 minutes in the evenings and on Sundays.",
     "Route 343 runs every 6 to 7 minutes Monday to\n        Saturday daytimes and every 10 minutes during the evenings and on Sundays.",
     "John Barry, TfL's Head of Network\n        Development, said:",
     "\"The extension of route 136  will result in more buses\n        on the busy section between Peckham and Elephant \u0026 Castle.  This boosts capacity for existing passengers and will help support new demand as estates in the area are redeveloped.\"",
     "This service change is part\n        of TfL's management and development of a network that comprises around 700\n        routes across Greater London operated by 7,600 buses at peak times, carrying\n        more than 2.4\n        billion passengers every year.",
     "TfL keeps the network under regular\n        review, working with the London boroughs and other partners to help ensure that\n        services can respond to London's changing travel needs.",
