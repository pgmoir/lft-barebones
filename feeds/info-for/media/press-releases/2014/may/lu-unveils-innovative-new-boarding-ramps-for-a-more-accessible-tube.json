     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"UK's first 'bridge style'\\n            ramp design closes the gap between platform and train where traditional ramps\\n            could not be used\",\"Three stations set to use\\n            this new ramp from next month, enabling step-free access from street to train,\\n            with more to follow later in the year\"]}",
     "More Tube\n        stations across the network are set to become easier to access for\n        mobility-impaired customers following work by LU to create innovative new\n        'bridge' style boarding ramps.",
     "The new ramps\n        have been designed to solve the problem at stations where there is a gap and\n        step down from platform to train.",
     "Traditional ramp designs are unsuitable for\n        use in these situations, so LU has been working hard to develop and trial a\n        unique new design, and gain the necessary approvals from the Department for\n        Transport and Office of Rail Regulation.",
     "The ramps will be introduced at three\n        Jubilee line stations during June - Kilburn, Stanmore and Wembley Park - making\n        journeys at these stations step-free from street to train, and fully accessible\n        to wheelchair users, for the first time.",
     "These will then be introduced at\n        further stations on the network later in the summer, following staff training.",
     "The work is part of a huge\n        range of improvements being delivered by the Mayor and TfL to continue to embed\n        the legacy of accessible travel promised after the 2012 Games.",
     "Many large-scale\n        accessibility improvements are underway including TfL investing £250 million in\n        step-free projects at stations including Bond Street, Greenford, Tottenham\n        Court Road, Vauxhall and Victoria.",
     "More step-free projects are being progressed\n        with third party developers and additional stations are being made partially\n        step-free. London will see\n        at least 25 London Underground and London Overground stations become step-free\n        over the next 10 years - as well as dozens of National Rail stations and\n        accessible Crossrail stations in the heart of the city.",
     "LU's programme\n        of accessibility work uses a mix of permanent level access at new stations,\n        permanent raised platform sections, low-floor trains and boarding ramps.",
     "By\n        2016 a third of Tube platforms will have level access by one of these means, up\n        from 15 per cent last year.",
     "Isabel Dedring,\n        Deputy Mayor for Transport said: \"We've been determined to create a\n         ramp which works at those tricky stations where there is a gap and step\n        down from platform to train. This innovative new design is a UK first and will\n        make a real contribution to boosting accessibility - opening up more Tube\n        stations to more people. This is just one of the measures we're carrying out to\n        make getting around London easier for everyone - including more step-free\n        stations, raised platform sections, new low-floor trains with the latest\n        accessibility standards and much more.\"",
     "Gareth Powell,\n        London Underground's Director of Strategy \u0026 Service Development said:\n        \"We've been using ramps to bridge the gap between platform and train since\n        2012, but disabled customers at some stations have missed out because\n        traditional ramps were not designed for the unique set up at some of our\n        stations, where there is a gap and step down from platform to train. These new\n        ramps will mean new travel options and better, more accessible journeys, for\n        our customers.\"",
     "Jeff Harvey from Transport\n        for All said: \"I am very happy to hear the new ramps will make Kilburn Station\n        and others accessible to me and\n        other wheelchair users, finally\n        opening up parts of the Underground network for\n        us to use. This will cut some of\n        my journeys down by over an hour, which\n        can make the difference between being able to attend an event, class or job\n        interview, or having to say no. It is encouraging that Transport for All and\n        our members were able to interact with TfL during planning and even participate\n        in testing the new ramps. I hope\n        such involvement continues so\n        that all remaining stations where a gap prevents people boarding the train can\n        benefit from a ramp.\"",
     "Transport for London has set\n        out how it will make the journeys of millions of disabled and older Londoners\n        even easier.",
