     "As part of the ongoing final phase of\n        maintenance works, the Hammersmith Flyover will be closed in one direction for\n        10 weekends from 30 May, to allow concrete deck repairs, resurfacing and\n        waterproofing works on the structure to be completed.",
     "The\n        closures will allow TfL to carry out waterproofing works which cannot be\n        carried out while traffic is using the structure. This will help extend the\n        life of the flyover, ensuring this vital part of the road network can continue\n        serving London for years to come.",
     "During\n        the weekend closures, which will be in place from 10.30pm on Friday until 5am\n        on Monday morning at the latest, any affected traffic will be diverted via the\n        road network beneath the flyover and the A40\n        Western Avenue.",
     "This will be clearly signed to diverted traffic.",
     "The eastbound\n        carriageway will be closed for the first five weekends, before switching to the\n        westbound carriageway for the remaining five weekends.",
     "The\n        repairs have been carefully designed to be carried out in the shortest\n        timeframe possible, helping to keep road disruption to a minimum.",
     "The works\n        have also been coordinated around other works planned in the local area later\n        this summer, including works to the Hogarth Flyover and Putney Bridge.",
     "Dana Skelley,\n        Director of Asset Management at TfL, said: \"Our work to complete vital\n        maintenance works to the Hammersmith Flyover are progressing well. These\n        weekend closures are required to allow us to complete the next section of works\n        as quickly as possible. Our overriding focus when planning these weekend works\n        has been to keep disruption to a minimum and we are ensuring that any affected\n        drivers will have a clear, signed diversion route to help them complete their\n        journey.\"",
     "Since October 2013, TfL has been working to complete the second and final phase\n        of works, which will see the remaining 11 of the flyover's spans strengthened\n        in a similar fashion to the five that were repaired during 2012.",
     "These works\n        have been primarily carried out overnight to reduce disruption to road users\n        and local residents.",
     "Work on\n        the structure is progressing well, with work to upgrade the central reservation\n        and drainage within the structure now fully underway.",
     "The first of the new\n        strengthening cables will start being installed from August 2014 and, later\n        this year, steel bearings within the structure will also be replaced.",
     "TfL has worked with key partners,\n        including the local boroughs, to ensure that the improvement work has been\n        scheduled to ensure these works are undertaken with the minimum of disruption.",
     "TfL has written to all local residents to inform them of the refurbishment, as\n        well as to other key stakeholders such as businesses and local transport\n        groups.",
     "More details about the refurbishment work are available on TfL's\n        website at \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/hammersmithflyover\"\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk/hammersmithflyover\u003c/a\u003e ",
     "The\n        restoration of the Hammersmith Flyover forms part of TfL's ongoing work to\n        bring London's roads to a state of good repair.",
     "The Mayor and TfL are doubling\n        their investment in the network from £2 billion to £4 billion across the next\n        10 years, helping to deliver the recommendations of the Mayor's Roads Task\n        Force (RTF) to tackle the challenges facing London's streets and roads.\n         \n        For\n        the latest travel information, please visit www.tfl.gov.uk/trafficnews\n        or follow @tfltrafficnews",
