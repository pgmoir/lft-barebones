     "Transport\n        for London (TfL) has appointed TateHindle as\n        the architect to prepare the planning\n        proposals for the redevelopment of its historic London Underground\n        Headquarters, 55 Broadway.",
     "In August 2013, TfL launched a competitive tender\n        for architects to submit their proposals for the future of the building.",
     "During\n        the tender process, TfL considered every potential option for the building with\n        office, hotel and residential uses all being evaluated.",
     "After detailed analysis\n        the conclusion was reached that a residential led development would deliver the\n        best value for fare and taxpayers and would also be the most suitable option to\n        maintain the heritage of the Grade I listed building.",
     "Graeme\n        Craig, Director of Commercial Development at TfL, said: \"We're pleased to\n        announce that TateHindle has been appointed as\n        the architect to take the planning process forward for 55 Broadway.  We\n        recognise the historic value of the building and the need to carefully ensure\n        that any future use enhances the building's historic features.",
     "\"We\n        remain committed to securing a future for the building that ensures it remains\n        a valued part of the fabric of London. We also have a responsibility to fare\n        and taxpayers to make sure that any redevelopment of 55 Broadway is a\n        commercial success, with all proceeds reinvested in London's transport network\n        to deliver increased and improved services.\"",
     "TfL\n        will be working closely with TateHindle and\n        will be leading on the planning application and the listed building approval\n        process, rather than engaging with an external developer at this stage.",
     "TfL\n        expects to submit the planning application in autumn 2014. \n        In the meantime, the building will continue to be used as an office for\n        TfL staff with plans for staff to remain there until 2015.",
     "Andrew Tate,\n        Director of TateHindle, said: \"We are delighted to have won this important\n        commission to work in collaboration with TfL on the 55 Broadway project. Our\n        design objective is to breathe new life into the building with a particular\n        focus on enhancing it's setting, whilst remaining respectful of its cultural\n        heritage and architectural integrity.\"",
     "Designed\n        by Charles Holden and built between 1927 and 1929, 55 Broadway has been London\n        Underground's iconic Headquarters for over 80 years and is situated above St\n        James's Park Tube station. The building was listed Grade II in 1970 and\n        upgraded to Grade I in 2011 by English Heritage on account of its outstanding\n        national historic and architectural interest.",
