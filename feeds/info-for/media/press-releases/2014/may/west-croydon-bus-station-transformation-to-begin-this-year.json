     "Bus passengers using West Croydon bus station will benefit from much improved facilities from early 2016 following Transport for London's (TfL's) successful planning application to redevelop the site.",
     "The plans firmly focus on the needs of the eight million passengers who use the station each year, bringing a more light and airy feel to the busy interchange, with better customer information, fully accessible bus stops and modern CCTV coverage for improved passenger safety.",
     "Work on the bus station, which is used by 150 buses per hour and is a popular interchange between Croydon Tramlink, London Overground and buses, will begin later this year.",
     "The new design will enable the bus station to manage a 20 per cent increase in passengers (1.6 million extra passengers a year) that are anticipated as a result of town centre improvements by the London Borough of Croydon.Part of the redevelopment will also include a retail unit.",
     "All income generated by TfL will be reinvested in the transport network for the benefit of customers.",
     "Dana Skelley, TfL's Director of Asset Management, said:",
     "'We are very pleased that from early 2016 West Croydon bus station will be completely transformed, delivering significant improvements for passengers and ensuring we are ready for future increases in passenger demand.Â  London Borough of Croydon has ambitious plans to redevelop the town and this station improvement ensures local transport contributes to its success.'",
