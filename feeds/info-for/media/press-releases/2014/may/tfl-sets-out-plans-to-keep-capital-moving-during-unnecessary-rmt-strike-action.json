     "Transport for\nLondon (TfL) today set out a range of measures to help keep London moving and\nopen for business next week, should a second set of strikes threatened by the\nleadership of the RMT union on London Underground (LU) go ahead. The RMT strike\naction is currently due to affect services from around 21:30 on Bank Holiday\nMonday 5 May and throughout the whole of Tuesday 6, Wednesday 7 and Thursday 8\nMay, with services not returning to normal until the morning of Friday 9 May.",
     "During this\nweek's strike action LU managed to run fifty per cent of Tube services across the\n48-hour action and carried up to 57 per cent of the usual number of passengers,\nfar higher than during the last strike in February.",
     "Up to 80 per cent of\nstations were open and around 90 per cent of Oyster cards that would usually be\nseen on the TfL network were seen - showing that Londoners continued to get\naround the city despite the disruption.",
     "The highest number of buses ever\ndeployed in London's history were also in action carrying over a million extra\npassengers and the Barclays Cycle Hire saw its busiest day ever with over\n49,000 trips on Wednesday.",
     "These strikes have been\ncalled by the leadership of the RMT union over plans to modernise the Tube.",
     "Under these plans, at the busiest stations there will be nearly a third more\nstaff visible and available to provide, on a permanent basis, the face-to-face\ncustomer service offered during the London 2012 Games.",
     "Visitors to London and\npeople with disabilities will be better looked after than ever before.",
     "The modernisation will see\nsavings of Â£50 million a year which will be reinvested in more frequent and\nreliable train services and will help keep fares down.",
     "LU has made five\ncommitments to customers",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"All stations will remain staffed\\n    and controlled at all times, with more staff visible and available to help\\n    customers and keep them safe and secure\",\"A new 24-hour service on core\\n    parts of the Tube network at weekends from 2015\",\"More frequent and reliable train\\n    services with better, more accessible stations\",\"Simpler ticketing, including\\n    contactless bank card payment with daily and weekly fares capping\",\"The best possible value by\\n    running our services as efficiently as possible while improving customer\\n    service\"]}",
     "From day one, LU has also guaranteed that\nmodernisation will be taken forward with no compulsory redundancies, a job for\neveryone who wants to continue working at LU and no member of staff sees their\npay cut as a result of the changes proposed.",
     "Talks between LU and the unions, three of\nwhich are not carrying out strike action, will take place at ACAS today. LU\nwill be urging the RMT leadership to call off next week's action. However, at\npresent, the RMT strike is still on and customers are asked to plan ahead",
     "Phil Hufton, London Underground's Chief operating\nOfficer, said: \"We\nare committed to maintaining and improving the Tube's excellent safety and customer\nservice record and our plans to modernise the Tube will do just that. It will\nincrease the number of visible staff on the network - by 30 per cent at our\nbusiest stations - who will personally serve our passengers, providing help for\ncustomers who need it most.",
     "\"Fairness to our staff is\nguaranteed.  As we have always made clear, there will be no compulsory\nredundancies, there is a job for all staff wanting to remain with us and no one\nwill lose pay. We have also made significant changes to our original proposals\nafter listening to our people and the unions.",
     "\"The only\nsensible course is for the RMT leadership to join us and the other unions in\ncontinuing discussions and to work with us to shape the future of the Tube,\nrather than threatening more pointless strike action which will only disrupt\nLondoners and lose staff pay.",
     "\"Should\nnext week's strike go ahead there will be some disruption, but we aim to build on\nwhat we delivered this week - when we ran over fifty per cent of Tube trains\nand kept eighty per cent of stations open - to provide an even better\nservice.\"",

     "Should the\nstrike action go ahead, LU will keep as many stations open and run as many\ntrains as possible.",
     "Services will be affected from 21:30hrs on Bank Holiday Monday 5 May\nso customers are asked to try and complete journeys as early as possible that\nevening.",
     "If your Oyster card needs topping up, it may help to do this in\nadvance of the industrial action starting.",
     "There will be disruption to journeys on Tuesday, Wednesday and\nThursday, when Tube services will start later and finish earlier than normal -\ntrains will run from around 07:00hrs to 23:00hrs.",
     "However, customers are advised that the last services from central\nLondon may depart significantly earlier than this, at around 9.30pm.",
     "Although\nit is not possible to say exactly what services we will be able to run, the\nline-by-line information below will help customers to plan journeys in advance. However,\ncustomers are advised that the situation may change throughout the day.",
     "Buses and other modes of transport may also be very busy. Those public\ntransport workers who are on duty during the strike will be doing their very\nbest to keep London moving and open for business.",
     "TfL asked customers for\ntheir patience during what may be difficult journeys.",
     "TfL Ambassadors\nand volunteers will also be on hand to provide customers with travel\ninformation and advice on the ground.",
