     "On Saturday 7 June 2014,\n        Alperton Bus Garage in north west London will open its doors to members of the\n        public in the second of a series of bus garage open days across the capital in\n        celebration of the Year of the Bus.",
     "The first bus garage open\n        day was held at Catford on 10 May and attracted around 3,000 visitors.",
     "Visitors to Alperton Bus\n        Garage, which is operated by Metroline and celebrates its 75th\n        birthday this year, will get the chance to:",

     "The bus garage open days are\n        part of TfL's celebrations to mark the Year of the Bus, in partnership with\n        London Transport Museum and the capital's bus operators.",
     "Events and activities are\n        being held throughout 2014 to celebrate the role that London buses, bus drivers\n        and the staff who support them play in keeping the capital moving, and mark a\n        number of important anniversaries.",
     "These include 60 years since the creation of\n        the original and iconic Routemaster, 75 years since the launch of its\n        predecessor the RT-type bus, and 100 years since hundreds of London buses were\n        sent to the Western Front to play a crucial role during the First World War.",
     "Alperton Bus Garage was\n        opened on 7 June 1939 next door to the London Underground station of the same\n        name on the Piccadilly Line and was built to serve the expanding suburbs of\n        north west London. Due to lack of facilities elsewhere, body overhauls were\n        undertaken at the garage during the Second World\n        War. Indeed, the garage itself suffered some\n        bomb damage during this period. The garage was\n        extended in the second half of the 1970s but still looks very similar to the\n        original building constructed 75 years ago.",
     "Buses are a vital daily\n        service for millions and one that is very local, with the vast majority of\n        Londoners (95 per cent) never more than 400 metres from a bus stop.  Buses\n        link homes to jobs, schools and hospitals in every part of the capital. \n        They are the backbone, and often the forgotten workhorses, of London's\n        transport network.",
     "Other London bus garages\n        opening their doors on Saturdays this summer are Stockwell Bus Garage (21\n        June), Fulwell Bus Garage (28 June), Potters Bar Bus Garage (5 July) and\n        Walworth Bus Garage (19 July). There will also be an open day at Dartford Bus\n        Garage on Sunday 7 September.",
