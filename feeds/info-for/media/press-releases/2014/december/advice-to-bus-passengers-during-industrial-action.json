     "Transport for London (TfL) has today issued advice to bus passengers ahead of planned strike action by members of the Unite union, who work for Tower Transit, which will affect bus services in east and central London on Monday 29 December and Monday 5 January.",
     "The strike is over a dispute between Unite and Tower Transit over bus driver pay and conditions.  Only around 22 per cent of Tower Transit bus drivers voted for strike action.  TfL is calling for Unite and Tower Transit to swiftly resolve the dispute so that passengers are not disrupted.",
     "Tower Transit operates less than 5 per cent of bus services in London and services operated by other companies across the capital are unaffected and will operate a normal service.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Disruption\"}",
     "The two 24-hour strikes are likely to result in severe disruption on a number of bus routes, with some services not running.   Some Tube services in London are expected to be busier than normal - so customers are being urged to allow a little more time to complete their journeys.",
     "The strike action on Monday 29 December will affect bus routes in east London including some routes which travel into central London.  On Monday 5 January the same routes will be affected and in addition some bus routes in west London will also be affected.  Bus services operated by other companies across the capital are unaffected and will operate a normal service.",
     "Mike Weston, TfL's Director of Buses, said: `I'd like to apologise to our customers in advance for any disruption they may face as a result of these strikes and would strongly advise them to check before they travel.  We'll be issuing information from a range of channels and our teams will be working hard to make sure that this information is up to date.",
     "`Bus drivers pay and conditions are a matter for Tower Transit and Unite to discuss, as it has been for the last 20 years, and we would urge them to seek a swift and fair resolution for the sake of our passengers.'",
     "Monday 29 December",
     "The strike action will take place between 00:01 and 23:59 on Monday 29 December - affecting services during the day on Monday and some services operating on Monday night into the early hours of Tuesday 30 December.  There are 13 bus routes affected that operate in east London, including some routes which travel into central London.",
