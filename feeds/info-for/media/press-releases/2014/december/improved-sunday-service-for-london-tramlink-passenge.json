     "London Tramlink passengers will soon be able to take advantage of a more frequent Sunday service running between between Wimbledon and New Addington, via Croydon town centre.",
     "From 14 December, between 10.00am and 6.00pm each Sunday, a tram will run every seven to eight minutes on this route (Line 3) compared to the current frequency of 15 minutes. This will make it even easier for customers wanting to travel to either Croydon or Wimbledon town centres to shop over the festive period.",
     "Transport for London's (TfL) Director of London Tramlink, Sharon Thompson, said: `We're pleased to be able to bring these extra services into operation at a time of year when we know it is important for our passengers to have access to weekend shopping destinations. I'm also pleased to say that the increase in Sunday services will be something that passengers will be able to reap the benefits of all year round.`",
     "As well as more frequent Sunday services, a new 700m section of double track has recently been completed between Mitcham Junction and Beddington Lane as part of the Wimbledon line enhancement programme. The new track will allow trams to pass more easily through this section and thus reduce delays. Work is also in progress to add a new bay to Platform 10 at Wimbledon station.",
     "When complete it will enable the introduction of an additional four new trams onto the network which will bring a 50% increase for the Wimbledon branch and double the line's capacity in 2016.",
     "London Tramlink is part of a large and growing TfL network of rail services, which also includes London Overground routes across the capital. From May 2015, West Anglia services from Liverpool Street station to Enfield Town, Cheshunt (via Seven Sisters) and Chingford and between Romford and Upminster will become part of TfL's integrated transport network. At the same time, TfL will also takeover rail services from Liverpool Street to Shenfield.",
