     "Town centres across East London are set to be transformed after the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, today confirmed £148m in funding for local transport and public realm projects in 2015/16. Local areas will see safer roads, better public spaces, improved walking facilities and cycling made safer and easier.",
     "The annual funding has been allocated by TfL to each London borough to support the delivery of its Local Implementation Plan (LIP) to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.",
     "In recognition of the importance of delivering road improvements in support of the Mayor's transport priorities, LIP investment levels of £148m per year have been maintained for next year, despite a reduction in TfL's central Government funding.",
     "LIP funding for 2015/16 will support a range of different transport initiatives across East London produced by the boroughs including:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Barking and Dagenham - £400,000 to improve the junction between Ballards Road and New Road, addressing long-standing safety and congestion issues, and making it easier for cyclists and pedestrians to use;\",\"Bexley - £1.5m towards a project to transform Bexleyheath Town Centre, which will improve access for pedestrians and cyclists from Albion Road, whilst also extending the improvements already complete to the western part of the Broadway;\",\"Greenwich - £2m towards reinvigorating Eltham High Street, with improved conditions for pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users;\",\"Hackney - £800,000 to help regenerate the shopping environment in Hackney Town Centre by pedestrianising Narrow Way to provide a safer and more inviting environment for pedestrians and cyclists;\",\"Lewisham - £300,000 to create a new pedestrian area near shops between the A205 and a new pool and library complex in Forest Hill;\",\"Newham - £1m to commence the detailed design on the conversion of Stratford Gyratory to two-way operation, reducing the dominance of traffic and significantly improving conditions for cyclists, pedestrians, public transport users. £120,000 to improve walking and cycling links around the Royal Docks.\"]}",
     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: `This funding is specifically targeted to provide benefits at key locations across London, helping to make the capital's roads and open spaces safer, more pleasant places to be. Providing better cycling and walking routes, as well as a raft of major improvements to our streets will help to boost the quality of life of those who live and work in our great city. By working with the boroughs to deliver better transport in their areas, we can in turn help to support jobs and economic growth in the capital as a whole.'",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Sir Peter Hendy CBE, said: 'This funding will continue to help deliver real improvements to communities in East London. We are working in partnership with East London boroughs to deliver hundreds of transport projects that will benefit local communities and all road users whether they are pedestrians, cyclists or drivers. Public squares and shopping areas will also be rejuvenated, attracting more people to those areas and boosting the local economy.'",
     "In addition to ensuring the boroughs have the necessary funding to improve the quality of their local roads TfL is also working with them to help improve efficiency, add value for money and keep the disruption of road and construction works to a minimum. For example, London Highways Alliance Contracts (LoHAC) help the boroughs avoid individually appointing contractors to undertake works. These are four area-based joint highway contracts, helping to reduce costs, provide consistency in the quality of works and materials and to minimise disruption.",
     "TfL is also working in partnership with London Councils to identify any gaps in skills and resources, which could be filled through more collaborative working between boroughs and TfL, such as apprenticeships, mentoring and sharing resources.",
     "Last year East London boroughs used TfL funding for their Local Implementation Plans to deliver a range of improvements for local communities through safer junctions, reduced traffic speeds and better walking routes.",
     "Significant projects in East London awarded funding last year include:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Havering - £130,000 for Rainham road safety improvements, which are providing better junctions for all road users accessing the town centre;\",\"Redbridge - £1.7m to complete to regeneration of Woodford Bridge and make it more accessible for pedestrians and cyclists;\",\"Tower Hamlets - £300,000 for improvements to Wentworth Street, making the area easier, and more pleasant, for pedestrians to use.\"]}",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Each borough produces a Local Implementation Plan (LIP) to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.  While Transport for London allocates funding for individual schemes, the LIP and delivery of individual projects is the responsibility of each borough.\"]}"
