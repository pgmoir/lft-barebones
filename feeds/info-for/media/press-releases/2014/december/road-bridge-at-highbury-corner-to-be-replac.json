     "Substantial work to replace the road bridge at Highbury Corner in Islington will begin in the New Year, as part of Transport for London's (TfL) continuing £4bn Road Modernisation Plan.",
     "The bridge on the A1 Holloway Road, which carries more than 25,000 vehicles a day over the railway lines by Highbury and Islington station, is now more than a century old and is in need of replacement. Following preliminary work, TfL will begin the main work in January 2015, which will see utility services diverted and the bridge deck removed and replaced with a new carriageway. The new bridge will reduce the need for ongoing maintenance and ensure additional weight restrictions will not need to be put in place in the future.",
     "As part of the works, the Post Office building, which is situated on the existing bridge, will be demolished. This will also begin in January and allow TfL to further improve pedestrian access to Highbury and Islington station. Cycle stands currently on the station forecourt will be relocated to Highbury Station Road.",
     "One lane of traffic in each direction will remain open throughout the duration of the works and TfL is working closely with Network Rail to gain access to the station and rail track when it is closed, rather than imposing additional closures on the line. Works will also be coordinated around matches and events taking place at The Emirates stadium to minimise disruption. Drivers are advised to regularly check before they travel by visiting www.tfl.gov.uk/trafficnews or following \u003ca href=\"http://@tfltrafficnews\"\u003e@tfltrafficnews\u003c/a\u003e , and bus users can find out how their bus might be affected by going to www.tfl.gov.uk/bus/status or following \u003ca href=\"http://@tflbusalerts\"\u003e@tflbusalerts\u003c/a\u003e .",
     "Nick Fairholme, Director of Projects \u0026 Programmes for Surface Transport at TfL, said: `Highbury Corner is a key junction in London and it is therefore important that we ensure that it can continue to remain usable and safe for years to come. We are committed to completing these bridge works as quickly and efficiently as possible and will keep the local community and road users informed of progress as we work to deliver these vital improvements.'",
     "Cllr Claudia Webbe, Islington Council's executive member for environment and transport said `These bridges are over 100 years old, so are in need of replacement. We're working hard with TfL to ensure residents are fully consulted with, and that these works keep disruption to a minimum. We hope this is the start of much-needed road and safety improvements at Highbury Corner and on the Holloway Road.'",
     "During these works, TfL will also continue to develop a scheme to remove the Highbury Corner gyratory, creating new facilities for pedestrians and cyclists as well as improving the look and feel of the local area. These improvements, which form part of TfL's 33 \"Better Junctions\" programme, will help transform the area and support the continuing regeneration of Highbury. A consultation will begin on the final concept design for these plans by late 2015.",
     "The major changes to the area around Highbury Corner form part of the wider work being carried out across London as part of TfL's Road Modernisation Plan. With a budget of £4bn from now until 2021/22, this overarching plan represents the biggest investment in London's roads in a generation, including hundreds of transformational projects within the existing road network. Using radical ideas and innovative designs, the plan will make London's roads greener, safer and more attractive for the benefit of all road users.",
