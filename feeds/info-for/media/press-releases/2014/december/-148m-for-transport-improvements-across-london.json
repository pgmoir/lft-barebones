     "Town centres across London's boroughs are set to be transformed after the Mayor and Transport for London (TfL) confirmed £148m in funding for local transport and public realm projects in 2015/16. Local areas will see safer roads, better public spaces, improved walking facilities and cycling made safer and easier.",
     "The annual funding has been allocated by TfL to each London borough to support the delivery of its Local Implementation Plan (LIP) to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.",
     "In recognition of the importance of delivering road improvements in support of the Mayor's transport priorities, LIP investment levels of £148m per year have been maintained for next year, despite a reduction in TfL's central Government funding.",
     "LIP funding for 2015/16 will support hundreds of different transport projects across the capital produced by the boroughs including:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"City of London - £224,000 to enhance public spaces and pedestrian routes. In 2015/16 the proposals are expected to include improvements to walking routes that by-pass Bank and improvements around Fishmongers' Hall Wharf, where people can enjoy views of the Thames;\",\"Hammersmith and Fulham - £350,000 towards designing new 20mph zones and tackling collision hot spots. £150,000 for a new cycle route on the A315 and £130,000 for environmental improvements on Stevenage Road;\",\"Merton - £200,000 towards improving cycling conditions in Wimbledon Town Centre, including identifying how the gyratory can be made safer and easier for cyclists and pedestrians to use;\",\"Haringey - £600,000 towards improving the public spaces around Green Lanes, which complements a major project to transform Wood Green which is due for completion in June 2015.  £422,000 for new 20mph zones across the borough;\",\"Newham - £1m to commence the detailed design on the conversion of Stratford Gyratory to two-way operation, reducing the dominance of traffic and significantly improving conditions for cyclists, pedestrians, public transport users. £120,000 to improve walking and cycling links around the Royal Docks;\",\"Westminster - £320,000 towards developing and implementing cycle schemes over the next three years, including sections of the Central London Cycle Grid, free cycle training, cycle parking, and improved cycle access to the Royal Parks;\",\"Barking and Dagenham - £400,000 to improve the junction between Ballards Road and New Road, addressing long-standing safety and congestion issues, and making it easier for cyclists and pedestrians to use.\"]}",
     "The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: `This funding is specifically targeted to provide benefits at key locations across London, helping to make the capital's roads and open spaces safer, more pleasant places to be. Providing better cycling and walking routes, as well as a raft of major improvements to our streets will help to boost the quality of life of those who live and work in our great city. By working with the boroughs to deliver better transport in their areas, we can in turn help to support jobs and economic growth in the capital as a whole.'",
     "London's Transport Commissioner, Sir Peter Hendy CBE, said: `This funding will help continue to deliver real improvements to communities across the capital. We are working in partnership with the boroughs to deliver hundreds of transport projects that will benefit local communities and all road users whether they are pedestrians, cyclists or drivers. Public squares and shopping areas will also be rejuvenated, attracting more people to those areas and boosting the local economy.'",
     "In addition to ensuring the boroughs have the necessary funding to improve the quality of their local roads TfL is also working with them to help improve efficiency, add value for money and keep the disruption of road and construction works to a minimum. For example, London Highways Alliance Contracts (LoHAC) help the boroughs avoid individually appointing contractors to undertake works, helping to reduce costs, provide consistency in the quality of works and materials and to minimise disruption. These are four area-based joint highway contracts, helping to reduce costs, provide consistency in the quality of works and materials and to minimise disruption.",
     "TfL is also working in partnership with London Councils to identify any gaps in skills and resources, which could be filled through collaborative working between boroughs and TfL, such as apprenticeships, mentoring and sharing resources.",
     "Last year London boroughs used TfL funding for their Local Implementation Plans to deliver a range of improvements for local communities, through safer junctions, reduced traffic speeds and better walking routes.",
     "Significant projects awarded funding last year include:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Haringey - £3.7m to help transform Wood Green by June 2015 and £150k towards improving the area around Green Lanes, which is also progressing well;\",\"Hammersmith and Fulham - £2.4m investment in a major project in Shepherd's Bush, which will be completed in June 2015 and includes segregated cycle lanes, greater enhanced streetscape and pedestrian facilities;\",\"Bromley - £1.05m towards the completion of the works at Bromley North Village, which is transforming the area by better connecting the vibrant local streets with the rest of the busy town centre.\"]}",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Each borough produces a Local Implementation Plan (LIP) to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.  While Transport for London allocates funding for individual schemes, the LIP and delivery of individual projects is the responsibility of each borough.\"]}"
