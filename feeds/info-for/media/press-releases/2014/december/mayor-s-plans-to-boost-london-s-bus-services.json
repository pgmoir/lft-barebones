     "The Mayor and Transport for London (TfL) today set out plans for a major new investment in bus services to help meet the rising demand of the city's rapidly growing population.",
     "London's bus network, which carries six and half million passengers every day, is already one of the most extensive and accessible anywhere in the world.  However, London's population is growing faster than any other European city and investment is needed to keep pace.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Extra Buses\"}",
     "To respond to this growing demand, funding for over 500 extra buses is planned over the course of the business plan, which will create additional capacity for an extra 2.9m customer journeys each week. Working with London's boroughs, an additional £200m will be invested in supporting the reliability of the bus network, which delivers 2.4bn passenger journeys every year. New funding will also support customer-focused bus driver training to improve customer service. The plans are part of TfL's draft Business Plan which will be considered at the TfL Board on Wednesday 10 December.",
     "The extra buses will be used to increase the frequency of bus services and improve transport connections to key growth areas, such as Barking Riverside and Elephant and Castle, providing high quality bus routes between new residential areas and local town centres. The investment will improve access to this vital form of transport across London, especially in outer London where around four-fifths of bus journeys take place.",
     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: `London buses carry more than 2.4 billion passengers a year - twice as many as the Tube. They are the backbone and workhorses of our transport network, playing an undeniably important role in London's economy. This major new investment in our bus services will help meet the demand of the city's rapidly growing population. It will also support regeneration of key growth areas - ensuring Londoners have a regular and reliable bus network to get them to jobs, schools and hospitals in every part of the capital.'",
     "Bus reliability and customer satisfaction is at its highest ever level. To boost this further and support London's growth, £200m is being invested in 'bus priority' schemes that will be delivered in partnership with local councils. These measures will deliver significant benefits to passengers - allowing buses to move around the city more freely, avoid traffic hotspots and offer customers an even more reliable service. Improvements will include extra bus lanes, 'bus only' turns, and the extension of bus lane operational hours.",
     "Around 80% of London bus services run on borough roads, so close collaboration is essential to the development of such schemes, many of which could be introduced without major infrastructure works.  TfL is now working with local London councils to help them propose, develop and introduce such schemes on local roads.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Staff training\"}",
     "As well as investment in physical measures, the Mayor and TfL will also be investing £25m over seven years in customer service training for bus company staff.  This will include a review of the BTEC qualification - the mandatory training programme for new bus drivers - to enable TfL to improve the customer care training of around 25,000 staff including new and existing drivers, supervisors and controllers. Drivers will learn how to communicate better with customers and respond more quickly to their needs.",
     "TfL's Business Plan, which sets out what will be delivered to support the Mayor's Transport Strategy until 2020/21, also includes plans to increase the capacity of London Tramlink on the Wimbledon to Croydon line by 50% and subject to business cases and affordability the potential for an extension of the Tramlink network to be progressed towards the end of the Business Plan period.",
     "Demand for London Tramlink has doubled since 2000 and the service now carries 31m passengers a year. Four new trams have been ordered to help reduce congestion on the route between Wimbledon and Croydon, with the first arriving in 2015. This, combined with doubling sections of track and platform works at Wimbledon, will improve access to central Croydon and allow 12 trams an hour to run in each direction during peak times. This will provide an additional 25,000 people with a journey time of less than 60 minutes to central Croydon, boosting the local economy.",
     "London's Transport Commissioner Sir Peter Hendy, CBE, said: `As London's population grows it is essential that we continue to invest in the transport network to get customers to their jobs and homes and to go about their daily lives. The number of passengers on the bus network is at its highest since 1959 and this investment will help address the growing demand, improving customers' journeys, bus reliability and customer satisfaction.'",
