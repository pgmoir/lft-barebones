     "Transport for London (TfL) will once again roll out London's first ever rainbow crossing in Trafalgar Square, to mark the moment that same-sex couples can convert their civil partnerships into marriages, following legalisation of the Marriage (same sex couples) Act 2013 which comes in to full-force on Wednesday 10 December 2014.",
     "The crossing will be located opposite the Charing Cross Road entrance on Trafalgar Square, near Nelson's Column.",
     "It will be in place from 07:30 until 19:00 on Wednesday 10 December. Couples can head down to have their pictures taken on the crossing in celebration of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) diversity, against a backdrop of one of London's most iconic locations.",
     "Martyn Loukes, Chair of TfL's LGBT+ Network, said:",
     "'Once again we're showing our support for our LGBT customers, families and staff in London, and we would love couples to come down have their picture taken to celebrate this momentous event. I'll be converting my civil partnership on the day, and will be marking the occasion by going to Trafalgar Square with my husband to have our picture taken on the crossing.'",
     "TfL first used the Rainbow crossing in London for Pride in London in June and then again in September at Arsenal Tube station to support the anti-homophobia in sport campaign. The crossing is similar to ones that have appeared in Brighton, Tel Aviv and Sydney.",
     "TfL is committed to championing equality and eliminating discrimination. It has a lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT+) network that is actively involved in community events and projects celebrating the diversity of staff, customers and families.",
