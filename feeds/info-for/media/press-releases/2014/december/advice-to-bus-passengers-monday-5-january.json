     "Transport for London (TfL) has today issued advice to bus passengers ahead of further planned strike action by members of the Unite union, who work for Tower Transit, which will affect bus services in east, west and central London on Monday 5 January.",
     "The strike is over a dispute between Unite and Tower Transit over bus driver pay and conditions. Only around 22 per cent of Tower Transit bus drivers voted for strike action. TfL is calling for Unite and Tower Transit to swiftly resolve the dispute so that passengers are not disrupted. Drivers from Tower Transit's Lea Interchange bus garage took strike action on Monday 29 December however the impact on services was only moderate with around 60 per cent of normal service operating throughout the day.",

     "The 24-hour strike is likely to result in severe disruption on a number of bus routes in east and west London, including some which travel into central London, with some services not running. Some Tube services in London are expected to be busier than normal - so customers are being urged to allow a little more time to complete their journeys.",
