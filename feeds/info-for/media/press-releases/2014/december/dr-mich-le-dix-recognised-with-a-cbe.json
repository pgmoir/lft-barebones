     "Dr Michèle Dix, Transport for London's Managing Director of Planning, has been recognised with a CBE in the Queen's New Year's Honours list for services to transport in London; and on February 5th 2015 moves to the new post of Managing Director of Crossrail 2, to make the case for, and implement, the next new rail scheme for London's growth.",
     "Michèle started her career at the Greater London Council (GLC) after completing her PhD in transport and land use planning, and became a chartered civil engineer through the GLC's transport planning graduate scheme.",
     "Michèle later joined Halcrow Fox in the private sector, where she became the Board Director of Urban Transport Planning before joining TfL in 2000.",
     "Michèle has been the Managing Director of Planning at TfL since June 2007, initially taking on the role as a job share. Prior to that she was co-Director of Congestion Charging, implementing, running and expanding the scheme as well as developing the Low Emission Zone.",
     "Michèle's role has seen her work across all areas of transport in the capital from designing bus lanes and pedestrian modelling at London Underground stations to developing strategies for airports.",
     "She has worked with the Mayor of London to develop the Mayor's Transport Strategy and has been instrumental in working with the Mayor's Roads Task Force to ensure London's road network is fit for the 21st century. Michèle also shares her knowledge and experience globally, as a member of the Policy Board of the international public transport association UITP.",
     "On 5 February 2015, she moves to lead the team developing Crossrail 2 as Managing Director Crossrail 2, to develop and implement the next large rail scheme for London to cope with its growing economy and population growth. Richard de Cani becomes Managing Director, Planning, for TfL from 5 February.",
     "Sir Peter Hendy CBE, London's Transport Commissioner said:\u003cbr /\u003e'Michèle is the best transport planner in Britain, and thoroughly deserves this national recognition. She is a female pioneer in the male-dominated world of civil engineering and transport planning both in the UK, where she has set the strategic thinking for London's future transport needs, and worldwide. She has been instrumental in the introduction of many successful projects in the capital and her contribution to developing our city has been immeasurable. As London continues to grow at an extraordinary pace, Michèle will play a new and essential role in developing Crossrail 2 for the future so that we can meet that need and ensure that we can continue to generate economic growth for London and the UK.'",
     "Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said:\u003cbr /\u003e'From her groundbreaking efforts in developing and introducing congestion charging to planning London's road capacity requirements, Michèle's dedication to the bettering of transport in the capital is simply staggering. Wise with words and considered in judgement she's played a significant part in helping to shape this city's future transport needs during my mayoralty. I'm delighted that as Michèle takes on her next public transport challenge - Crossrail 2 - she's received this national nod of recognition.'",
     "Dr Michèle Dix, CBE said:",
     "'It is an honour to receive this award, especially as we are celebrating 100 years of women working in the transport industry. My role is hugely rewarding and I am very proud to have worked on some of the key transport projects that make a contribution to improving life in the capital. With London's population set to grow to 10 million people by 2030 the need for continued energy, thought and ambition being given to transport projects has never been greater. Thus I'm excited with my new challenge to lead the development of Crossrail 2, London's next big essential transport scheme. I'm also really delighted that Richard de Cani will succeed me as the Managing Director of Planning.'",
     "Richard de Cani has over twenty years experience in town planning and transport planning working in both the public and private sector including over 10 years at TfL. He has been involved in many aspects of planning for transport in London including key roles in the development of the DLR network, the planning of transport for the 2012 Olympic Games, development of the Mayor's Transport Strategy and planning the Northern Line Extension to Battersea and the Garden Bridge. He has been working as the Director of Transport Strategy and Planning for the past five years with Michèle Dix.",
     "TfL continues to mark 100 years of women working in transport, commemorating women taking on roles on buses and Tubes in the First World War, and being involved in building landmarks such as Waterloo Bridge, often called the 'Ladies Bridge', which opened in December 1945.",
     "Michèle has an active role in encouraging women into transport and engineering, and mentors up-and-coming London leaders as part of the not-for-profit Future of London project. She is also TfL's Equality and Inclusion champion, leading TfL's work to ensure all of London's diverse population benefit from access to transport, and that TfL's workforce reflects the city it serves."
