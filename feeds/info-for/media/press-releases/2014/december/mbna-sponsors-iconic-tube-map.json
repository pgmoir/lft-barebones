     "Transport for London (TfL) has today announced that MBNA, the contactless card issuer, will sponsor London's iconic Tube map, including 1,300 large Tube maps displayed across the network and 28 million pocket Tube maps for one year until November 2015.",
     "The sponsorship is part of TfL's creative and innovative plans to develop its commercial estate to generate around Â£3.4bn revenue, all of which will be reinvested back into the transport network to improve the services for customers.",
     "A record 4.725 million journeys took place on London Underground's network on 28 November and with more and more people using the Tube, the map is a vital tool in helping customers understand the network and how to get around London.",
     "MBNA is one of the UK's leading credit card providers and one of only a few 100% contactless card issuers. MBNA has been working with TfL since 2012 when contactless payments were first accepted on London's buses. Contactless can now be used on the Tube, London buses, London Tramlink, DLR, London Overground and most National Rail services in London.",
     "Over 18 million journeys have been made using contactless payments since 16 September 2014, making up over 10% of all pay as you go journeys in London and allow customers to travel using their bank card without the need to top up their Oyster card.",
     "Graeme Craig, Director of Commercial Development at TfL, said: `Sponsorship is a key part of TfL's commercial activities, generating revenues that we can reinvest back into our transport network to make journeys better for everyone and also to bear down on fares. I am delighted with our new partnership with MBNA, which reflects our mutual desire to see technical innovation deliver greater convenience for TfL's customers.'",
     "Michael Donald, Commercial and Customer Experience executive for MBNA said, `Our aim at MBNA is to make life easier for our customers. Travelling from the train, or one of the MBNA Thames clippers, to the Underground and grabbing a sandwich and a coffee before jumping on the bus, should be effortless with an MBNA contactless credit card.",
     "`In addition, if you're using one of our many rewards cards, whether that's a Chelsea FC, Virgin Atlantic or WWF credit card, you can also rest in the knowledge that your travel and everyday spending is contributing to your rewards points.'",
     "The sponsorship of the Tube map also coincides with the redesign of the artwork of the Tube map cover. Art on the Underground has commissioned Daniel Buren, one of France's leading artists, to design the new artwork for the 21st edition of the Tube map cover. Possibly one of the most widely viewed art commissions in the world, 14 million copies of the Tube map are distributed throughout the London Tube network. Buren is the first artist in this series to use the Underground's iconic roundel symbol in their artwork.",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Images are available from the TfL Press Office\",\"London Underground established Art on the Underground in 2000 initially under the title Platform for Art, with the purpose of producing and presenting new artworks that enrich the journeys of millions on the tube every day.\"]}",
