     "The\n        new trains will enable greater frequencies on the Jubilee and Northern lines\n        and support Tube services for the proposed Northern line extension from\n        Kennington to Battersea.",
     "LU\n        has placed a notice with the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU)\n        seeking expressions of interest to supply new trains for the Jubilee and\n        Northern lines.",

     "Alongside\n        new modern signalling systems, the additional trains will help LU meet the\n        challenge of London's growing population - set to increase from 8.2m today to\n        around 10m by 2030 - by increasing capacity in central London on the Jubilee\n        line by 13% and on the Northern line by 25 per cent.",
     "Gareth\n        Powell, Director of Strategy \u0026 Service Development for London Underground\n        said: `When these extra trains are in service by 2021 central London customers\n        will benefit from at least 30 trains per hour on the Northern line and at least\n        34 trains per hour on the Jubilee line during peak times.Â  By combining\n        the orders for new trains for two lines we will ensure that their delivery\n        represents value for money for our customers.'",
     "The\n        new trains are part of a huge programme of modernisation being carried out by\n        London Underground, with major stations, trains, track and signalling being\n        modernised or replaced to provide more capacity for a growing city.",
     "The line\n        upgrades are at the core of LU's investment programme, which will deliver more\n        than 30% increase in capacity. The upgrade programme is being delivered\n        over the coming years, with work on upgrades to the Northern, Circle, District,\n        Hammersmith \u0026 City and Metropolitan lines well underway.",
     "Redevelopment\n        work to increase capacity at key stations and make them step-free, is underway\n        at a number of stations including Victoria, Tottenham Court Road and Bond\n        Street and more than half of London Underground's 270 stations have now been\n        modernised or refurbished to make them brighter and easier to use, with\n        improvements such as tactile strips and better CCTV and help points, electronic\n        information displays in ticket halls and on platforms, and improved seating and\n        lighting.",
