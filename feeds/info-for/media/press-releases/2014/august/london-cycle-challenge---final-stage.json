     "Transport for London (TfL) has launched the third and final stage of its London\n        Cycle Challenge to keep the capital cycling.",
     "The\n        challenge will run until 5 September and this time cyclists are encouraged to\n        achieve a personal cycling goal. The challenge will act as a great warm-up for\n        the Friends Life Tour of Britain which finishes in London on Sunday 14\n        September.",
     "Participants\n        can use a mobile app to make it easier to record rides, set targets, and\n        encourage friends and family to give cycling a go.",

     "Chris\n        Mather, Head of the Community Engagement programme at TfL, said:  `Achieving a\n        personal cycling goal, whether that be to cycle every day or to get back on a\n        bike for the first time in a long time, is a great opportunity to encourage\n        more people to cycle more safely more often. The emphasis is to make that goal,\n        and keep it, plus participants are in with a chance of winning fantastic prizes\n        to boot.",
     "`With\n        a million spectators witnessing the Tour de France Stage 3 in London last\n        month, 80,000 people riding in Prudential RideLondon last weekend and the\n        Friends Life Tour of Britain coming to a climax on 14 September, interest in\n        cycling in the capital has never been higher. The challenge will give Londoners\n        the incentive they need to take to, and keep to, two wheels.'",
     "People\n        wishing to take part in the challenge who don't have a bike can use Barclays\n        Cycle Hire. In just three easy steps, users can hire, ride and return a bike at\n        any available docking station.",
     "Over the weekend of 16 and 17 August, to\n        celebrate Barclays Cycle Hire's fourth anniversary, access to the bikes will be\n        free for all. Using a bank card, anyone will be able\n        to saddle up on a cycle hire bike for a 24-hour period, and as long as the\n        trips are kept under half an hour people can make as many rides as they wish,\n        all for free. \n         \n        For more information on the\n        London Cycling Challenge or cycling in London, go to \u003ca href=\"http://tfl.gov.uk/cycling\"\u003etfl.gov.uk/cycling\u003c/a\u003e ",
