     "Latest\n        performance figures from Transport for London (TfL) show that London\n        Underground (LU) operated more than 98% of scheduled train journeys in\n        the first period of 2014/15, the highest level in six months.",
     "The figures,\n        for Periods 1 and 2 of the current year (1 April to 26 April and 27 April to 24\n        May), follow 2013/14's record performance, when LU carried 1.265bn passengers.",
     "Passenger numbers are now up by a third over the last ten years.\n         \n        More than\n        5.5m kilometres were operated during Period 1 with network peak and off peak\n        scheduled kilometres operated at 97.6% and 98.5% respectively.",
     "In period 2, excluding the two days of industrial action by RMT, the Northern\n        line matched the record high of 99.7% of scheduled kilometres operated,\n        while Victoria line performance was at its highest level for over a year with\n        98.7% of scheduled kilometres operated.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Fewer delays\"}",
     "Overall\n        delays to Tube customers continue to be reduced as LU remains on track to meet\n        the Mayor's commitment to reduce delays by a further 30% by 2015.",
     "Delays to customers have been reduced by 54% in the financial year\n        2013/4 compared with 2003/4, and 34% since 2008/9.",
     "Phil Hufton,\n        LU's Chief Operating Officer, said: `Demand for Tube services continues, and\n        we've recently increased services on the Victoria, Northern, Jubilee and\n        Piccadilly lines to cope with that level of demand.`These\n        service improvements are part of the continuing modernisation of the\n        Underground, with major stations, trains, track and signalling being modernised\n        or replaced to provide more capacity for the growth of London'",
     "The\n        continuing trend of long-term improvement on the Tube follows the success of\n        the London Underground Reliability Programme, introduced in 2011.  London\n        Underground continues to develop and implement more reliable solutions to meet\n        the Mayor's commitment of reducing delays on the network.",
