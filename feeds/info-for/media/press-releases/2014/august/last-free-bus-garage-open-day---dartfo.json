     "Dartford Bus Garage has a history stretching back to the\n        1920s and covering two sites, with the first garage built in 1927 on Kingsfield\n        Terrace in Priory Road. It served the people of Dartford and surrounding areas\n        until its closure on 18 January 1986 with a new depot opening at its current\n        location the following day. Between 1963 and 1965, five purpose-built vehicles\n        operated from the garage taking cyclists and their bicycles through the\n        Dartford Tunnel - the Thames Trader Cycle Carrier had seats on the upper deck\n        for cyclists and racks below for their bikes.",
     "The first bus garage open\n        day in celebration of the Year of the Bus was held at Catford on 10 May and\n        attracted around 3,000 visitors.",
     "Alperton, Stockwell, Fulwell, Potters Bar and\n        Walworth bus garages have all also offered behind-the-scenes access as part of\n        the Year of the Bus celebrations.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Vital role of the bus\"}",
     "Events and activities are\n        being held throughout 2014 to celebrate the role that London buses, bus drivers\n        and the staff who support them play in keeping the capital moving, and mark a\n        number of important anniversaries.",
     "These include 60 years since the creation of\n        the original and iconic Routemaster, 75 years since the launch of its\n        predecessor the RT-type bus, and 100 years since hundreds of London buses were\n        sent to the Western Front to play a crucial role during the First World War.",
     "Buses are a vital daily service\n        for millions and one that is very local, with the vast majority of Londoners\n        (95 per cent) never more than 400 metres from a bus stop.",
     "Buses link\n        homes to jobs, schools and hospitals in every part of the capital.  They\n        are the backbone, and often the forgotten workhorses, of London's transport\n        network.\n         \n        Further information about\n        other Year of the Bus events can be found at \u003ca href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/yearofthebus\"\u003ewww.tfl.gov.uk/yearofthebus\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk\"\u003ewww.ltmuseum.co.uk\u003c/a\u003e .",
     "The\n        Year of the Bus is supported by and delivered in partnership with Exterion\n        Media, Abellio, Arriva London, Clear Channel UK, Go-Ahead London, Metroline,\n        RATP Dev UK, Stagecoach, Wrightbus, Optare and Telent Technology Services.",
     "The\n        garage serves an area from Catford to the west, Erith to the north, Bluewater\n        to the east and Joydens Wood to the south. Even though the depot is based in\n        Kent, only three of the seven routes run into Kent. The rest serve Greater\n        London."
