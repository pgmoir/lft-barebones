     "London Underground today issued advice to customers should strike\n        action on the Central line, threatened by the leadership of the ASLEF union, go\n        ahead this Friday.",
     "The ASLEF action is currently due to take place all day on Friday\n        22 August.  If it does go ahead there the Central and Waterloo \u0026 City\n        lines will be severely affected.  Parts or all of both lines may be\n        suspended, and if trains do run they will be at a reduced frequency.",
     "We do not\n        expect any trains to run early morning/late at night.  Customers are\n        advised to seek alternative routes, avoiding the Central and Waterloo \u0026\n        City lines.",
     "We do not expect Central\n        line trains will run in central London.  TfL will deploy extra buses on\n        key routes and TfL Ambassadors and volunteers will be deployed to key\n        Underground and bus stations to provide customers with travel information and\n        advice.",
     "Other Tube services, the\n        DLR, London Overground and National Rail will operate normally. These services\n        are likely to be busier than usual and journeys made outside traditional peak\n        hours are likely to be easier.",
     "Nigel Holness, London\n        Underground's Operations Director, said:  `Should Friday's strike go ahead there will be disruption on both the Central\n        and Waterloo \u0026 City lines.  We will have staff and volunteers across\n        the network to help customers with their journeys but I advise people to plan\n        ahead and check before they travel. All other Tube, DLR and London Overground\n        routes will be operating as normal.",
     "`We're disappointed\n        that ASLEF leadership is planning strike action while discussions are still\n        ongoing.  Strike action is not necessary and we urge them to continue\n        talks with us to understand and resolve their concerns rather than threatening strike action which will only disrupt\n        Londoners and lose staff pay.  We have made good progress together and\n        have resolved a number of issues and I would ask ASLEF to see sense and call\n        off this unnecessary action whilst we continue talking and seek to resolve the\n        outstanding issues.'",
