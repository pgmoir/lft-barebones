     "London Underground (LU) is operating\n        reduced service on the Central line due to a unnecessary strike called by the\n        leadership of the ASLEF union, services on the Waterloo and City line are also\n        not running.",
     "The Central line is\n        operating a limited service between White City and Ealing Broadway and\n        Leytonstone and Epping, services are expected to finish earlier than normal and\n        customers travelling home this evening are urged to check before they travel\n        and seek alternative routes.",
     "Customers who would normally travel on the east end of the Central\n        line towards Epping are being advised to use Greater Anglia train services from\n        Liverpool Street, Hackney Downs or Walthamstow Central and travel to\n        Chingford where a replacement bus service is operating from Chingford to Epping\n        via Loughton. Customers for Woodford and South Woodford are advised to take the\n        Victoria line to Walthamstow Central and change for local bus services.",
     "TfL has deployed extra\n        buses on key routes and TfL Ambassadors and volunteers are helping customers\n        with travel information at key Underground and bus stations",
     "Other Tube services, the\n        DLR and the London Overground are operating normally.",
     "These services are likely\n        to be busier than usual and journeys made outside peak hours are likely to be\n        easier.",
     "Nigel Holness, Operations Director for\n        London Underground, said:  `Despite\n        some progress being made during talks, ASLEF leadership decided to press ahead\n        with this unnecessary strike action and disrupt customers journeys today. Our staff and\n        volunteers are working hard to keep London moving and I would advise our customers where possible, please  plan ahead and\n        check before you travel.'",
