     "From\n        Saturday 30 August route 66 will convert from single to double deck buses.",
     "Route\n        66, which is operated by Arriva Kent Thameside, runs from Romford Station\n        to Leytonstone via\n        Romford Market, Chadwell Heath, Newbury Park Station, Gants Hill Station,\n        Redbridge Station and Wanstead Station.",
     "On\n        Saturday the route's 60 capacity single deck buses will be replaced by double\n        deck buses that can carry 87 passengers.",
     "This\n        improvement has been made by Transport for London (TfL) to ensure\n        that all passengers throughout the route can benefit from higher capacity\n        vehicles.",
     "In particular the\n        service is very busy in both directions around\n        Newbury Park Station,\n        where many passengers\n        interchange with the Central line.",
     "The change allows the withdrawal\n        of the limited supplementary single-deck journeys which were introduced last\n        October as a temporary measure pending double-deck buses becoming available.",
     "John\n        Barry, TfL's Head of Network Development for buses, said: `The number of\n        passengers using route 66 on weekdays has grown by 15% since 2012.\n        Converting this route to higher capacity double-deck buses responds\n        to feedback from passengers and local councillors, with benefits to all\n        passengers on route 66.`",
     "This service change is part\n        of TfL's management and development of a network that comprises around 700\n        routes across Greater London operated by 7,600 buses at peak times, carrying\n        more than 2.4 billion passengers every year. TfL keeps the network under\n        regular review, working with the London boroughs and other partners to help\n        ensure that services can respond to London's changing travel needs..",
