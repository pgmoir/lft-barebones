     "London's Deputy Mayor for Transport, Val Shawcross CBE, visited Transport for London's (TfL's) Birmingham-based supplier DK Rewinds today (Tuesday 4 October) to meet the staff who support the Capital's transport network. By providing parts and undertaking repairs to London Underground trains, they help to keep the city moving.",
     "DK Rewinds specialises in repairing the traction motors that power Central line trains. The family-owned business produces new components for motors that match the originals, meaning faulty trains on the Central line can be quickly fixed and brought back into service.",
     "TfL has a long-standing relationship with DK Rewards, and over the last six years has invested £18m with the company. DK Rewinds has two sites in Birmingham employing over 60 full time staff, including three electrical engineering apprentices.",
     "Around 60 per cent of TfL expenditure is made with companies based outside London. This investment supports 60,000 jobs outside the Capital and 6,500 jobs in the West Midlands.",
     "Val Shawcross, Deputy Mayor for Transport, said:",
     "'TfL has been working with DK Rewinds for a number of years to maintain and repair our Central line trains. They have a brilliant relationship with the supplier and it's great to see London's transport network supporting jobs and growth in Birmingham.'",
     "Balvinder S Bhogal, Managing Director at DK Rewinds, said:",
     "'We have been working with TfL for 30 years as a key supplier. This has enabled DK Rewinds to invest in our workforce, which includes training apprentice and graduate engineers. The work we receive from TfL is very important to the Midlands and the region benefits greatly from these business links.'",
     "Sustained investment by TfL means that suppliers can have greater confidence to invest in their businesses with new technology, better ways of working, apprenticeships and skills.",
     "Notes to Editors:",
