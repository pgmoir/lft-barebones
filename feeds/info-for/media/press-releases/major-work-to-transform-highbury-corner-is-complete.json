I'd like to thank everyone in their area for their patience, whilst these vital works have taken place and we hope that local residents enjoy their new public space.'",
     "The work to transform Highbury Corner is part of TfL's Safer Junction's programme, which is reducing danger by overhauling London's most intimidating and dangerous junctions. Work has now been completed at 31 junctions across the capital, with another ten set to be complete by May next year. Major work to remove another outdated and intimidating roundabout at Old Street, in partnership with Islington and Hackney Councils, is progressing well and is set to be completed next year.",
     "TfL is working to enable millions more journeys to be made by walking and cycling as part of the Mayor's plans to tackle some of the biggest challenges facing the capital, including the global climate emergency, toxic air and obesity.",
     "In September, four new Cycleways were launched across London and construction on a number of major new routes is either under way or set to begin this year. Work on Cycleway 4 between Tower Bridge and Greenwich began in June, whilst work on Cycleway 9 between Brentford and Olympia is planned to start later this year. Construction work also continues on Cycleway 34 between North Acton and Wood Lane."
