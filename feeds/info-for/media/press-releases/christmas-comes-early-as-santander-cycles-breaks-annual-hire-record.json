     "London's flagship cycle hire scheme has achieved another record-breaking year with more than 10.3m journeys made using Santander Cycles in 2017.",
     "Seven of the 11 months so far have beaten year-on-year records for the number of journeys made. October was the best on record for the scheme, with just under one million hires. In total there have been more than 67m journeys since the scheme was launched in July 2010.",
     "Among many improvements made to the popular scheme this year was the introduction of a new bike built by England's longest established cycle manufacturer, Pashley Cycles in Stratford-upon-Avon. The new cycles offer riders improved handling, visibility and comfort, with a new gel saddle, lower frame, tyres with puncture prevention, new gear hub and improved front and rear Blaze lighting.",
     "This record breaking year is expected to continue over the festive period as Santander Cycles will be available throughout the festive period, including Christmas Day. The scheme is also set for a bumper start to the year as Santander Cycles will extend into Brixton, with seven new docking stations, providing space for up to 200 bikes.",
     "The expansion of Santander Cycles is an example of the Mayor of London's commitment to cycling, which has seen record levels of funding allocated. This will deliver more joined-up cycling infrastructure right across the city and includes funding for new Cycle Superhighways, Quietway routes, and a new cyclist and pedestrian crossing linking Rotherhithe and Canary Wharf.",
     "Will Norman, London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, said: \"It's been another hugely successful year for Santander Cycles, with record hires and the launch of our brilliant new bike. The scheme is such a great way for all abilities to cycle around our city, I've no doubt that their popularity will continue to increase, especially as we expand them into Brixton early next year.\"",
     "David Eddington, TfL's Head of Cycle Hire, said: \"This year has been a remarkable success for Santander Cycles, with the launch of the next generation of bikes and new records being set for the busiest, months and year. 2018 will also be an exciting one as the scheme extends into Brixton in the New Year, allowing even more people to enjoy the benefits of cycling.\"",
     "Keith Moor, Chief Marketing Officer at Santander said: \"The Santander Cycles Scheme is a great example of our commitment to supporting local communities and helping people and businesses prosper. Through the partnership with TfL we have worked to bring excitement and innovation to the scheme, whilst making it more accessible, enjoyable and giving people the confidence to cycle around and explore this fantastic City.",
     "\"This year has been our best year yet, not only did we launch the new smart cycles, but we also announced that the scheme will be extended to Brixton next year. It's been great to see records broken and hires on an upward trend, we look forward to more exciting plans in 2018.\"",
     "Encouraging people to cycle is one of the key components of the Mayor's draft Transport Strategy to help Londoners lead healthier and more active lives. Part of this ambition is providing a world class cycle hire scheme, which will help Londoners get about quickly, while benefiting their health and improving air quality.",
