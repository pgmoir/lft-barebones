     "In total, 113 roundels are being manufactured for installation at the two new Northern Line Extension stations, which are scheduled to open in autumn 2021 - 62 for Battersea Power Station and 51 for Nine Elms.",
     "Not yet visible to the public, the arrival of the new roundels signifies an important milestone in the construction of the Northern Line Extension, the first major Tube line extension since the Jubilee line in the late 1990s.",
     "The extension will connect Kennington to Battersea Power Station, via Nine Elms, bringing Battersea and surrounding areas to within 15 minutes of the City and the West End.",

     "The new roundels, among the most recognised and imitated logos in the world, are being manufactured at family-owned AJ Wells \u0026 Sons Ltd on the Isle of Wight where London transport signage has been produced for generations.",
     "They are the first roundels to be manufactured for a new Northern line station since the opening of the extension to Morden in 1926.",
     "Work to extend the line is currently focused on the fit-out of the new stations including the installation of escalators, installing the power supply, and extending the signalling used on the Northern line into the extension.",
     "The extension is enabling the regeneration of the Vauxhall, Nine Elms and Battersea areas, spurring economic growth by supporting around 25,000 new jobs and more than 20,000 new homes.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eHeidi Alexander, London's Deputy Mayor for Transport, said\u003c/strong\u003e : 'It's really exciting to see roundels now in place at Battersea Power Station - it makes the opening of the extension next year feel so much closer.",
     "'These are the first new Northern line roundels in nearly 100 years and their arrival brings to life the huge difference the extension will make - easier journeys for thousands of Londoners, as well as supporting the creation of new jobs and homes in our city.'",

     "'As well as new roundels, our two Northern Line Extension stations now have track, platforms and escalators as their transformation from concrete shells to state-of-the-art stations continues apace.",
     "'The arrival of the new roundels also demonstrates how sustained investment in the capital's transport infrastructure benefits not only Londoners but the whole country, through the extensive business supply chain.'",
     "In addition, the two new Northern Line Extension stations will feature newly commissioned permanent artworks that will be incorporated into the ticket halls of each station.",
