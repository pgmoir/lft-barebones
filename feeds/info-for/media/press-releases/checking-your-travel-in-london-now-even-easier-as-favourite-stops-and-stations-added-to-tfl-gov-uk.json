     "TfL has now added a favourites function to \u003ca href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/\"\u003etfl.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e , making it easier for customers to plan their Tube journeys or check when their next bus is due.",
     "Customers just need to go to \u003ca href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/\"\u003etfl.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e and click or tap on the star in the top right corner of the screen.",
     "This will bring up a favourites menu which will allow people to save their most frequently used Tube lines, tram line or river bus line, as well as receive details about major roads, bus routes or specific bus stops.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Prioritised services\"}",
     "These services will then be prioritised on the \u003ca href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/\"\u003etfl.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e homepage so customers can quickly check the status of their most frequently used line or route more easily.",
     "When there is disruption on the network this information will also be prioritised on the front screen to help customers better plan their journeys in advance.",
     "Phil Young, Head of Online at TfL, said: 'Around 60% of all visitors to \u003ca href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/\"\u003etfl.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e access using a mobile device so we can now help provide more personalised travel information to customers as they move around the city.",
     "'This is just part of our continuous work to make our website quicker and easier to use, alongside our collaboration with developers to bring new products and services covering public transport and roads to our customers quickly.'",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Reliable, accessible and timely\"}",
     "Janet Cooke, Chief Executive at London TravelWatch, said: 'Reliable, accessible and timely information is a key priority for us so this feature is a welcome addition to the TfL website.",
     "'It will make it easier for passengers to plan their routes and change their journeys at times of disruption and will be particularly useful for people accessing the website 'on the move'.'",
     "Further improvements to the website will be made throughout the year, including the ability to 'favourite' specific journeys so customers can tell if there is any disruption along their regular routes.",
     "Improvements are also planned for the Oyster and Contactless account webpages to help make it easier for people to register their cards and get information about their recent journeys.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Helping millions of Londoners\"}",
     "TfL is also helping millions of Londoners plan their journeys more easily across the Capital by continuing to make information it holds openly available to developers to assist them in creating better products and services more quickly.",
     "Around 8,200 developers are now registered for TfL's Unified Application Program Interface (API), with more than 2,000 new developers signed up to access live information in the last six months.",
     "As smartphone usage for travel information continues to increase, almost 500 apps are now being directly powered by this open data - providing Londoners with up-to-the-minute information about public transport and the road network.",
