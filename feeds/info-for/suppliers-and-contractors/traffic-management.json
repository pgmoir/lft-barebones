     "This guidance is aimed at keeping people safe when they travel on London's road network by foot, by cycle or by bus. It supplements existing national standards - we expect anyone involved with the design, planning, implementation and inspection of temporary traffic management on the TLRN to follow this guidance.",
     "It will not only make roads safer for vulnerable road users - people who walk, cycle and ride motorcycles - but will help unlock the barriers to active travel faced by people who are visually impaired, or who use wheelchairs and other mobility aids. Those carrying out roadworks will also be able to help us keep buses reliable and protect the accessibility of bus stops.",
     "The overall aim is to ensure that works are not a barrier to people travelling. Our vision is to accomplish a zero-risk standard for roadworks operations by 2025.",
