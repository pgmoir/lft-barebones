     "We work closely with Guide Dogs so their assistance dogs are trained to use escalators across our network. Only trained dogs with appropriate identification can use moving escalators. If your dog is not trained, staff will help you avoid escalators (for example by using lifts and stairs). If you can't avoid the escalator they will stop it so you can walk. This may not be possible in busy periods so staff will help you replan your journey by another route.",
