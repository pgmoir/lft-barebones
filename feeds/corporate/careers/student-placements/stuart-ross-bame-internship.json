     "The Stuart Ross BAME Press Office Internship is a diversity initiative targeted at students of African, Afro-Caribbean, Asian or Chinese origin (or a combination of the above) who are studying or have recently graduated. These groups are under-represented regionally, and nationally, in PR which is why we created this scheme in 2006. In 2016, the internship was renamed the Stuart Ross BAME Internship after TfL's former director of news Stuart Ross, who passed away in January 2016 after a battle with cancer. Stuart was a passionate supporter of the scheme from its inception and a key part of its success to date.",

     "Based in one of the UK's busiest press offices, you'll get a sense of what working in a high-pressured PR environment is like and the essential skills you need to start your career in PR. From the beginning of your internship, you'll be involved in handling the big stories of the day affecting London's transport and delivering dedicated stories and campaigns.  You'll learn all the skills you need to work in public relations, from writing press releases, dealing with journalists and managing media interviews to generating ideas for high profile campaigns and organising media events.  These could include campaigns like the 'Please offer me a seat' badge, art on the underground and London Poppy day.",

In both cases, this programme has been highly successful and our interns have gone on to work in public relations and communications roles in TfL as well as the Metropolitan Police, Marks \u0026 Spencer, NHS, local government and the Arts Council.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"How we'll develop and support you\"}",
     "Whilst on the scheme, we'll support your technical development through a wide range of on-the-job practical experiences and placements.  We'll also support your professional development through a combination of classroom-led training courses, online training courses, mentoring opportunities and structured networking opportunities with scheme alumni. You will receive one-to-one support throughout the programme from your scheme sponsor and your Line Manager. You'll also be connected to a 'buddy' who will be an alumnus from the scheme.",
