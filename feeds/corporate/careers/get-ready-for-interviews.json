     "Interviews at TfL are designed to give you the opportunity to show that you have the skills to do a job even if you don't have all the experience for that particular role.",
     "These are called competency-based interviews. Lots of other organisations use them too.",
     "The questions we ask are trying to find out if you have the right skills for a job. You will be asked to describe situations from your past that show how you cope with different situations.",
     "For example, for some roles you might be asked to describe a situation where you had to help a colleague who was having difficulties.",
     "The competencies you need for a job are usually listed in the job description. They will include things such as Customer Focus, Collaboration, Communication and Influence.",
     "How you do things can be just as important as what you do - we call this behaviours. When we assess people for roles at TfL, we look at what they can do and also how they go about doing it.
