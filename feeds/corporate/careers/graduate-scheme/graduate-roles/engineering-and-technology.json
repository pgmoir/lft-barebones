     "Our Engineers focus on the assets that form the foundation of our transport system.  London never stops and the engineering challenge which we face in modernising and upgrading our systems has been likened to undertaking open heart surgery on a patient while they are running a marathon!",
     "Your work will span multiple transport modes, delivering large scale projects and enabling a reliable operation of one of the world's most iconic transport networks.  Our projects include new rail lines, rail extensions, new river crossings, congestion relief enhancements at major stations, development of traffic control technology and multi-discipline upgrades to existing lines.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"What you'll be doing\"}",
     "As a graduate, your two year development programme will be made up of up to eight placements, each typically lasting three months. You will also undertake a series of short front line experience (\"FlEx\") placements to gain perspective of our Engineering internal operations and maintenance customers.",
     "Our aim is to equip you with the range of skills and experience you need for your successful career. We also understand that everyone's career and ambitions are different, so every graduate's journey with us is unique.",
     "This scheme will focus on three main areas of Engineering. Here's an idea of what yours could look like:",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"Electrical Engineering\"}",
     "Covering all aspects of the electrical assets that keep London's transport system moving. Your placements could include Road and Rail Signalling, Vehicles, Building Services and Power.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"Systems Engineering\"}",
     "Working across all transport modes, helping us to get the most out of our assets. Your placements could include Road and Rail Signalling, Control and Information, Operations, Telecoms and Cyber Security.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"Technology Engineering\"}",
     "Using new and emerging technology to solve complex technical problems by focusing on electronic, networking, telecoms and cybersecurity solutions.   Your placements could include Systems Engineering (early life-cycle), Systems Integration (implantation phase), Performance Engineering and Technical and Strategy Innovation.",
     "Whichever your preference, you will undertake a range of challenging placements in order to gain an overview of the transport system and find out the area of work which best suits you. Beyond these placements you will have exceptional freedom in building your own scheme, selecting opportunities to learn and deliver work that suit your skills and aspirations.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"What we look for\"}",
     "Everything we do as an organisation is aimed at ensuring that our evolving city remains future-proof for millions of Londoners. Our talented graduates form a vital part of that vision, so it's essential that we find the best people to help us do this.",

     "As a member of the team, we'll give you responsibility and the opportunity to add value from day one.  If you are excited by inspiring and influencing the future of London, are up for a challenge and thrive under pressure, then this is the career path for you.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Where you can take your career\"}",
     "Our Engineers have the opportunity to make a huge impact. Upon completing the scheme we would expect you to \"roll off\" into one of our functional engineering teams, aligned to a specific engineering discipline or specialist area.  You will then continue to develop your craft as an engineer through a series of assignments across TfL, progressively taking on more challenging roles in order to build a core competence in the functional area you have chosen.",
     "In five years, we would expect you will be taking on Senior Engineer level assignments, leading engineering teams and liaising with internal and external stakeholders to deliver complex projects.  This experience in turn will facilitate your application for Chartered Engineer status. Graduates can go on to undertake engineering management roles on multi-discipline projects of national importance, directly improving the experience of the travelling public and transforming how London works.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"How we'll develop and support you\"}",
     "Whilst on the scheme, we'll support your technical development through a wide range of on-the-job practical experiences and placements.  We'll also support your professional development through a combination of classroom-led training courses, online training courses, mentoring opportunities and structured networking opportunities with scheme alumni. You will receive one-to-one support throughout the programme from your scheme sponsor and your Line Manager. You'll also be connected to a 'buddy' who will be an alumnus from the scheme.",
