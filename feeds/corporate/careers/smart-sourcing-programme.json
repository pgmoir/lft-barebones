     "We want our workforce to reflect the diversity of London, and Smart Sourcing helps us to find really good people from a wider range of backgrounds.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"What is Smart Sourcing?\"}",
     "Some groups of people are likely to face barriers to employment, even though they have a great deal to offer.",
     "Through Smart Sourcing, we support and encourage them to apply for roles at TfL and in the wider transport industry.",
     "Those supported by Smart Sourcing include ex-service people, people who have been out of employment for long periods, young people from disadvantaged backgrounds and ex-offenders.",
     "We developed Smart Sourcing to help TfL to benefit from a workforce as diverse as the population of London. Our successful employees include many people who haven't had a conventional career or who have faced difficulties along the way.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Attracting talented people to TfL\"}",
     "We  let people know about the opportunities available by running insight days with partner organisations such as the Career Transition Partnership (CTP).",
     "These give people an insight into the many different roles across our business - such as Service Controllers who run the signalling across our network. They also provide attendees with information on how to apply, and employability skills training so that they are better equipped to manage the assessment process.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Helping people find a route into work\"}",
     "We make it as easy as possible for people who face barriers to get work at TfL.",
     "For example, we run a work placement scheme for armed forces service leavers, helping them to move into civilian roles in project management.",
     "In 2016/17 we offered 14 placements and 24 permanent roles to armed forces veterans.",
     "We run similar schemes for other groups who face barriers to employment such as people returning to work after a long career break.",
     "We run an outreach programme, 'Moving Forward' for apprenticeships, targeting deprived boroughs and girls' schools. Our aim is to increase social mobility and attract more girls into roles involving science, technology, engineering and mathematics.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Helping candidates prepare\"}",
     "We run employability skills workshops in London prisons and with other groups of people who need extra support to get into work.",
     "We run stands and presentations at employment fairs at schools, local boroughs, Wellington Barracks, and other organisations across London.",
     "We also provide advice, templates and examples to help people prepare for interviews and assessments.  See our \u003ca href=\"/corporate/careers/employability-toolkit\"\u003eEmployability toolkit\u003c/a\u003e .",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Helping  employees develop their careers\"}",
     "Smart Sourcing isn't just about getting the right people into the organization - we want to enable all our employees to reach their full potential. Once someone has joined us, the programme continues to support them to develop their careers within our business.",
     "We run initiatives such as Automatic Shortlisting, to help our middle managers progress so that we can  improve diversity at senior management level.",
     "We run skills workshops and insight days for staff: for example targeting women who may want to move into Train Operator or Service Control roles but haven't had the confidence to do so.",
