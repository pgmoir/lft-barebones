     "Exploiting technology to produce better and faster results is one of our organisation's six priorities. Technology and Data (T\u0026D) will consistently provide cost effective, reliable, secure and innovative technology and data services.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"About the role\"}",
     "We never stop looking for ways to improve the service we provide to our customers; whether that's giving our frontline staff the tools and technology they need to give live travel information, or making the transport network more accessible to all.  Every journey really does matter.",
     "Our Level 3 apprenticeship in infrastructure will provide you with a comprehensive structured training programme over two years with an introduction to a variety of areas and the skills an IT infrastructure technician needs.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"Placements\"}",
     "On this apprenticeship scheme you'll complete various 3-4 month-long placements. Within each placement you'll get hands on experience in a variety of technologies, where you'll work alongside engineers, and on your own, to resolve issues as they arise.",
     "As an infrastructure technician you'll be responsible for providing support to internal and external customers. You'll be expected to configure, maintain and troubleshoot systems that have direct impact on our daily operations. This will include a wide range of technologies such as: Wintel, Unix, SQL, Exchange, Lync, Citrix, Oracle, Storage, SCOM and SCCM. Working with experienced professionals, challenges can range from remote monitoring, estate changes, to overall improvements that mean we can operate more efficiently.",
     "Within 18 months, you'll be skilled sufficiently and in a position to be a valuable asset to your team.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"About you\"}",
     "On this new, exciting and challenging apprenticeship you'll work towards achieving a Level 3 infrastructure technician qualification.",
     "It's important for you to meet all the requirements of the scheme so you can pass the end of your assessment. Towards the end of the scheme, we'll also start trying to find out which areas of TfL you'd like to work in. Where possible, we try to find placements for you in the areas you'd like to continue after the scheme, so you can get the right experience for your career goals.",
     "Successful completion of your apprenticeship could land you a role as an infrastructure analyst or in one of our many other T\u0026D teams.",
     "Learn more about the benefits and development for all of our apprenticeships schemes, and find out exactly what we're looking for.",
     "If you're successful you'll have to pass pre-employment checks before joining. These will include reference checks, qualifications checks, right to work in the UK and in some cases a medical and a Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) check."
