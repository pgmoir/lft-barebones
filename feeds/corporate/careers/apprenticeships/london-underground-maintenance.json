     "The work will vary from placement to placement but will be specific to particular disciplines. You will work with a team of qualified and licensed engineers at all times, who will provide oversight and guidance throughout your programme, teach you the skills required for the role and most of all, pass on their extensive knowledge and experience. The work will be split between practical work (competence) and theory work (knowledge) throughout the programme and you'll be expected to produce a portfolio of evidence to demonstrate your growing competence and understanding.\u003cbr /\u003eAn example of the type of work you could be doing: As a lifts and escalators apprentice you'll learn all there is to know about how to assess, dismantle, inspect, repair, reassemble and test all elements of our suite of lifts and escalators across the network. Our assets are subject to continual use and without them being able to operate effectively and efficiently the impact on our passengers will be significant. With 440 escalators and 188 lifts servicing 5 million passengers per day, it is critical that we can maintain all of these units with minimal disruption to keep London moving.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"What will the programme involve?\"}",
     "You'll follow an exclusive training programme at our Engineering \u0026 Skills Academy at Acton Town, honing the skills required to become a fully rounded, competent engineer. You'll learn the core skills needed to work safely on our network and gain a basic foundation in all aspects of rail engineering.",
     "Depending upon business priorities, you could stream into any of the specific disciplines below; however there are a variety of other rewarding areas that you could go into where your skills will be further enhanced and developed to become a qualified engineer by the end of the programme.",

     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"What do we look for?\"}",
     "You will be highly motivated and proactive, with a passion for engineering. If you're a logical thinker with a strong ability to problem solve to tackle technical challenges then this scheme is the perfect way to kick start your career.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"Where can this career take me?\"}",
     "The apprenticeship scheme is just the start of your career. On completion of the scheme, the roles and opportunities available to you are endless. You may want to work your way up to the highest particular qualification and license in your discipline, or you may want to move into a Team Leader, Depot Manager or Operational Manager role. The current Director of Engineering and Major Projects Director for TfL both started as technician apprentices so it can be seen that the apprentices can aspire eventually to senior management positions. You may however want to remain as a hands-on engineer, growing in knowledge and experience and passing on your skills to the next generation of apprentices.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"What training and support will I get?\"}",
     "For the duration of the scheme you'll have a business sponsor that is responsible for the design and delivery of the apprenticeship scheme. They will help secure the right placements for you and support you in your professional development. You'll also have a mentor that'll support and guide you sharing their knowledge and expertise.",
     "During the scheme you'll not only complete the qualification but also have opportunities to complete additional training courses. These will vary from soft skills training to technical skills training. Your sponsors and placement managers will ensure you attend all the relevant training to support you in your role.",
