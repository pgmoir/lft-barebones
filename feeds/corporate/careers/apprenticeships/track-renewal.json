Our Capital Programmes Directorate has an apprenticeship opportunity for you to train to become one of our engineers and leaders of tomorrow.",
     "The Advanced (Level 3) Apprenticeship programme provides you with a combination of on-the-job training, working with professional and experienced engineers, project managers, commercial teams, and classroom training with our fully accredited and experienced external training provider. Initially, gaining the essential safety and practical training competencies and licences you'll need throughout your career, you will follow a structured placement programme. This programme will give you first-hand experience of our deep tube and open section track and drainage renewal activities, and introduce you to engineering principles, specifications, standards and contractual and commercial agreements. You'll have all the support you need from your sponsors and placement managers.",
     "During the first 18 months you will work to gain your NVQ Level 2 Diploma in Rail Engineering and Underpinning Knowledge. On completion of the Intermediate Apprenticeship you will progress to the Advanced (Level 3) Apprenticeship gaining an NVQ Level 3 Diploma in Rail Engineering as well as academic studies to achieve a diploma in engineering. During the Advanced Apprenticeship you will follow a further structured placement programme designed to provide you with additional skills in project management, project / construction engineering, surveying, track and signal design etc. which builds upon the skills and knowledge acquired in the first 18 months.",
     "Both schemes incorporate spending time with our training provider where you will complete your Technical Certificate and academic studies.",

     "If you have a keen interest and a real passion and enthusiasm for engineering then this scheme is for you. You'll be part of a varied and challenging apprenticeship, learning from our professional and experienced engineers along the way. Successfully completing the apprenticeship means you'll have all the skills and knowledge required to be able to apply for registration as an engineering technician (Eng Tech) with the Engineering Council.",
