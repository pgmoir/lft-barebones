This could be either a BA Hons; BSc Hons or BBA Hons, accredited by a body such as the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET). This will include vocational and academic elements to allow you to work towards chartered membership of the IET in the future.",
     "It's important for you to meet all the requirements of the scheme so you can pass the end of your assessment. Towards the end of the scheme, we'll also start trying to find out which areas of TfL you'd like to work in. Where possible, we try to find placements for you in the areas you'd like to continue after the scheme, so you can get the right experience for your career goals.",
