Finally you can expect to have a buddy, either a previous apprentice or graduate from this scheme. Your buddy can answer any day to day questions you have and share their experiences with you.",
     "During the scheme you'll not only complete the qualification but also have opportunities to complete additional training courses. These will vary from soft skills training to technical skills training. Your sponsors and placement managers will ensure you attend all the relevant training to support you in your role.",

     "On completion of the apprentice scheme you'll have gained experience across a range of areas from stations, rolling stock and different business areas. This will open up a large number of junior engineering roles for you.
