     "As London's population continues to grow, it's vital that the transportation network supporting it also continues to evolve to meet the new demand. For over 150 years the London Underground network of tunnels and stations has played a key role in allowing the city to thrive. However, to maintain and expand this vast network, we need highly skilled and experienced engineers and designers.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"About the role\"}",
     "We've designed this apprenticeship scheme to find the next generation of talent who can keep London Underground evolving. Over the course of the scheme, you'll work alongside experienced engineers across a range of engineering disciplines, learning the function of computer aided design (CAD) and the art of producing engineering drawings. You'll be at the heart of engineering design, using innovation and creativity to turn visions into reality through CAD and building information modelling (BIM). As an apprentice you'll support a wide range of projects essential to the maintenance and improvement of London's underground rail network.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"Placements\"}",
     "You'll complete a number of placements during the scheme, with your first year being spent in London Underground's Capital Programmes Directorate (CPD) in the central CAD team. After your first year you'll work in other engineering disciplines, such as:",

     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"About you\"}",
     "On this varied and challenging apprenticeship, you'll gain an NVQ Level 3 Diploma in Engineering Construction Design and Draughting and a BTEC National Certificate in Construction and the Built Environment. Through a combination of on-the-job learning from leading professionals and experienced CAD modellers and engineers, and classroom training, you'll develop valuable skills, gain a broad range of industry experience and take the first steps towards a career as a CAD designer. You'll also benefit from additional training including:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Bentley Micro station V8i (CAD software)\",\"2D and 3D modelling\",\"Producing engineering drawings\",\"Introduction to BIM\"]}",
     "So, if you're a creative individual who's interested in and enthusiastic about technical drawing and designing, then this is the apprenticeship scheme for you. Working on both large and small projects, either as part of a team, or independently, you'll be performance driven and have  excellent organisational skills.",
     "Once you've successfully completed your apprenticeship, you'll be able to demonstrate you have the flair and technical knowledge to accurately model within CAD professionally.",
     "Learn more about the benefits of all our apprenticeships schemes, and find out exactly what we're looking for.",
     "If you're successful you'll have to pass pre-employment checks before joining. These will include reference checks, qualifications checks, right to work in the UK and in some cases a medical and a Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) check."
