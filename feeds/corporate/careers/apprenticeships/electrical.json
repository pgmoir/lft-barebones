     "Our Tube trains and infrastructure are powered by electricity drawn from the National Grid at a number of supply points across London. This power is manipulated and distributed by the London Underground Power Delivery Division, through approximately 300 substations spread across 250 miles of track.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"About the role\"}",
     "The Power division distributes and manages nearly all electrical power required to run the Underground system. This includes the 270 stations which handle approximately five million travelling passengers a day, and our own emergency power station at Greenwich. All power assets are extensive, expensive and highly technical and have to be in top condition for the Underground to run.Your role as an electrical fitter will be to maintain and operate the power equipment in our substations, using your training and expertise to provide a professional service for our travelling customers.",
     "On the scheme you'll work in substation plant maintenance, which spans many disciplines. During your training, you'll learn about the operation of complex components, including high and low voltage switchgear and cables, 415VAC switchgear, direct current switchgear, battery, protection, compressed air, power quality, power generation and SCADA control systems. Apprentices are also trained and licensed in the operation, switching and safe isolation of these components.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"About you\"}",
     "On this challenging but rewarding apprenticeship you'll follow a structured four-year programme, gaining a wide range of experience and learning how areas of power function.  You'll learn how to read electrical and mechanical drawings, train to write reports, fault find, condition monitor, and understand the use of predictive maintenance techniques which include: thermal imaging, trending and profiling.",
     "You will also be expected to attend college and/or university to study electrical engineering, in an academic capacity, to gain your technical certificate as part of the apprenticeship. The programme will provide you with a mixture of on-the-job training, working with professional and experienced engineers in power and electrification.",
     "By the end of your apprenticeship you will have the following qualifications:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Various core safety training\",\"Level 3 Apprenticeship in Rail Infrastructure Engineering (Electrification)\",\"City \\u0026 Guilds 7597-16 NVQ Certificate in Rail Engineering Electrification Maintenance\",\"BTEC Level 3 Diploma in Electrical / Electronic Engineering\",\"BTEC Higher National Certificate / Diploma in Electrical / Electronic Engineering\"]}",
     "Learn more about the benefits and development for all of our apprenticeships schemes, and find out exactly what we're looking for.",
     "If you're successful you'll have to pass pre-employment checks before joining. These will include reference checks, qualifications checks, right to work in the UK and in some cases a medical and a criminal records bureau (CRB) check."
