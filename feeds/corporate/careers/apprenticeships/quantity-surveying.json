     "One of the biggest challenges we face is upgrading an infrastructure which dates back to 1863, while still running an efficient service. It also makes this an exciting time to be part of our organisation; you'll contribute to our capital investment and on-going maintenance activities across the transport network, which could include other areas of the transport infrastructure, such as London Overground and DLR.",
     "The Quantity Surveying apprenticeship provides comprehensively structured training over two years and introduces you to a variety of areas. You'll get the opportunity to do placements around the business to gain a broad knowledge of different types of projects, and an understanding of what it takes to keep London's transport system running on a daily basis.",
     "You could find yourself working within the Rail and Underground, Surface Transport or our Commercial team in Corporate Services, helping to deliver some of the most exciting and challenging transport, rail, highway and engineering projects in London. Wherever it is, you'll work as part of a team on projects and interact with other disciplines like engineers, HR professionals, or project managers.",
     "Designed to give your career a real kick-start, this apprenticeship is split into six-month placements, where you'll work in a team with a support structure in place.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"About you\"}",
     "During your varied and challenging apprenticeship, you'll gain a Level 3 National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) in surveying, property and maintenance. You'll also become an associate member of the Royal Institute of the Chartered Surveyors (RICS). Once you complete your Level 3 apprenticeship, there could be an opportunity to continue your apprenticeship onto a Level 6 Higher Apprenticeship, gaining a degree in quantity surveying along with full professional membership of RICS.",
     "Our professionals and experts want to pass on their knowledge and skills onto the next generation of project staff. With a combination of on-the-job training and classroom training, you will be ready to move into a junior quantity surveyor position, with further career progression opportunities at the end of your apprenticeship.",

     "If you're successful you'll have to pass pre-employment checks before joining. These will include reference checks, qualifications checks, right to work in the UK and in some cases a medical and a Criminal Records Bureau check.",
