     "Your team is improving the TfL Journey Planner to include the total cost of the journey. This will make it easier for customers to predict the cost of unfamiliar journeys and to enable them to choose the most cost-effective route for their needs.",
     "You will develop the software running in Microsoft's Azure Cloud platform, which provides the underlying data to the TfL mobile app. This new innovation is part of a series to make traveling in London more affordable and convenient. It allows busy customers to manage their Oyster card from their mobiles, including topping up, purchasing travel cards and viewing journey history. Low balance notifications help ensures that they have enough PAYG credit to travel, so they don't need to queue for a top-up when starting a journey.",

     "During the programme you will complete four six month placements within small development teams. There are many different types of software development and you will have the opportunity to learn and experience a uniquely broad range of skills including web development, cloud computing, high performance algorithms and database development.",

     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"What training and support will I get?\"}",
     "The majority of your training is delivered on-the-job, pairing up with your team colleagues and learning from them.  Technical training in software design and programming is also provided, which covers the knowledge modules of the apprenticeship standard.",
     "For the duration of the scheme you'll have a business sponsor that is responsible for the design and delivery of the apprenticeship scheme. They will help secure the right placements for you and support you in your professional development. You'll also have a mentor that'll support and guide you, sharing their knowledge and expertise. Finally you can expect to have a buddy, either a previous apprentice or graduate from this scheme. Your buddy can answer any day to day questions you have and share their experiences with you.",
     "During the scheme you'll not only complete the qualification but also have opportunities to complete additional soft skills training courses.  Your sponsors and placement managers will ensure you attend all the relevant training to support you in your role.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"What do we look for?\"}",
