     "The work will vary from placement to placement however for all of them you'll have the opportunity to make a huge impact on the millions of journeys customers make across London each day. You may find yourself working on maintaining and improving the structures and earthworks of the present London Underground. You might be working on site on the delivery of step free access schemes to improve accessibility to the network. You could be given the chance to complete a placement on a major project such as the Silvertown tunnel river crossing. All these activities will directly make a positive improvement to many Londoners' daily lives. Ultimately, the work you'll be doing on this scheme means helping to ease congestion and open up new connections between communities as an area is regenerated.  You'll be working with many different people affected by the project, as well as our own team and suppliers. This could include meeting with groups from the community to help ensure our neighbours understand what we are doing and how the project will benefit London.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"What will the programme involve?\"}",
     "You'll complete placements in a range of different parts of the business in order for you to gain experience in a wide range of civil engineering activities. A few may be office based but it is likely most will involve time out and about on the network. Placements on the existing transport networks will include some routine maintenance engineering to inspect and maintain the current structures.  Other placements will be in project teams designing or constructing completely new infrastructure. The work could range from minor highway improvements to the delivery of major projects such as Crossrail 2, the Silvertown road tunnel and the Barking Riverside rail link.",

Finally, you can expect to have a buddy who can answer any day to day questions you have and share their experiences with you.",
     "During the scheme you'll not only complete the qualification but also have opportunities to complete additional training courses. These will vary from soft skills training to technical skills training. Your sponsors and placement managers will ensure you attend all the relevant training to support you in your role.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"What do we look for?\"}",
