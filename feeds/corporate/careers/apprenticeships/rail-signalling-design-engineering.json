     "Although the systems being introduced are more modern, the principles underpinning signalling and service control systems are largely unchanged from the traditional technology, this means that the skills you gain apply to both legacy and modern (old and new) systems.",
     "An apprenticeship in rail engineering design is a springboard to becoming a  signaling or control and information engineer.",
     "In-house design generally covers small to medium sized projects, such as point and crossing renewal, local performance improvements, and station refurbishments, etc. Larger projects,  such as line upgrades, are typically done by external contractors, while our in-house team is responsible for specifying and accepting designs. There will be opportunities to learn more about new technology when secondments to contractor teams come up throughout your placement and even after the apprenticeship.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"Placements\"}",
     "You'll have a number of placements during the scheme which will provides you with a good overview of rail signalling design.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"About you\"}",
     "On this varied and challenging apprenticeship, you'll gain a level 3 qualification as a rail engineering design technician. Through a combination of on-the-job learning and classroom training, you'll develop a diverse knowledge and wide range of skills needed for a successful career in Engineering.",
     "So, once you have successfully completed your apprenticeship, you'll take up a position in our in-house Signal Design team or in one of the large project delivery teams in order for you to enhance your skills further. From here, you'll then have opportunities to continue developing into one of our resident experts who are responsible for specifying, accepting or approving design modifications.",
     "Learn more about the benefits of all our apprenticeships schemes, and find out exactly what we're looking for.",
     "If you're successful you'll have to pass pre-employment checks before joining. These will include reference checks, qualifications checks, right to work in the UK and in some cases a medical and a Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) check."
