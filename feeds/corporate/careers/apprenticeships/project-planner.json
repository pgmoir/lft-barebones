Following that, you'll begin a comprehensive, structured training programme designed to introduce you to a variety of areas and give your career a real kick start. You'll learn from the experts who work on our infrastructure, upgrade and operations planning, and work on sites which directly manage the supply chain to deliver reliable, timely and cost-effective work.",

You'll get first-hand experience of upgrade and operational projects on Highway, Rail and London Underground. We'll support your development by providing you with the skills needed to work in and around major capital programmes/projects. This means you'll gain a basic understanding of specifications, standards and contractual agreements.",

Planners are essential to the delivery of our complex projects and because of their fluid nature, there'll always be an opportunity to move between projects to hone your planning skills.",
