     "Rail systems performance engineering is at the heart of the design of our railway. Our network is made up of different systems so wee need to understand how they work, how they interact and how to create solutions to drive increased capacity for our customers. Ultimately, we need to know how to improve reliability and efficiency on our services.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"About the role\"}",
     "We are experts at building computer models to simulate the behaviour of the various facets of the railway, which we can use to test out designs. These might be designs based on the performance of new trains, the capability of the power network, or the capacity of the signalling system.",
     "Initially, you'll have an induction to explain everything there is to know about us, the role and where you fit in. After that, you'll go on our Railway Engineering Simulator (RES) training course which uses a computer model to help you build a virtual railway and operate virtual trains. This will help you to understand how all the railway components come together to deliver a train service.",
     "Throughout the scheme you'll gain a broad knowledge of all the different types of railway assets, get an insight into different areas of our business, and an understanding of the design processes behind everything we do.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"Placements\"}",
     "Placements last between three-nine months in duration, so you'll get good experience of working on real life projects and applying your knowledge to improving the London Underground. Your work will directly shape the future of our railway, which may lead to faster journey times, better energy efficiency, or improvements to train service reliability.",
     "Your placement could be in any of the following teams:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Train systems performance engineering\",\"Infrastructure systems performance engineering\",\"Modelling software development\",\"Signalling design\",\"Track design\",\"Computer aided design \\u0026 3D modelling\",\"Core Asset information \\u0026 Global Information Systems\",\"Railway system reliability\",\"Asset condition monitoring and prognosis\",\"Human performance engineering\",\"Train testing\",\"Maintenance engineering\",\"Track and infrastructure surveying\",\"Research and development\"]}",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"About you\"}",
     "On this varied and challenging apprenticeship, you'll gain a Level 4 Higher Rail Systems Advanced Technician qualification. You'll also meet the requirements for professional registration via the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), as Engineering Technician under the Engineering Council's UK-SPEC framework.",
     "Once you've successfully completed your apprenticeship, you'll demonstrate the competency requirements to potentially secure a technician engineer position with further career progression opportunities such as assistant engineer, engineer, and engineering manager.",
     "Our engineering community is made up of over 2000 people which, combined with the breadth of our intermodal transportation network, creates a variety of opportunities for staff to progress and develop in new areas.",
