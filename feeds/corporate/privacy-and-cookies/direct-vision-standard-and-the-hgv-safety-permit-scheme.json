     "From time to time we may also send you travel related information about the Safety Permit scheme, the Direct Vision Standard (DVS) or other Road User Charging schemes operating in London. Examples might include consultations on proposed changes, updates on permit standards, the level of charges or hours of operation.",

In addition we do not sell or rent personal data to third parties for this purpose.",
     "We will enforce the scheme with our network of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras that capture an alpha-numeric 'read' of a VRM and photographic (still) images of the vehicle. These are the same cameras that we use to operate the Congestion Charge, Low Emission Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone.",
     "Our IT system will check whether a particular HGV vehicle seen by the cameras has a valid safety permit or is fully exempt from the safety permit scheme. If that's the case, the images will be deleted. If the vehicle is non-compliant, TfL will retain the data for enforcement purposes.",

     "When doing this, we replace the VRM with an alternative set of letters and numbers. This is called 'pseudonymisation' and is a way of distinguishing vehicles in a dataset by using a unique identifier that does not reveal its 'real world' identity.

     "Permits will be issued on an automated basis where your application is for a vehicle with a Star Rating of 1 or above. Vehicles that are exempt from (or not subject to) the permit scheme will also be automatically identified from the information provided in your application.",

This includes the customer database, the installation and maintenance of the cameras, the secure IT connection to the DVLA and debt recovery services within the UK and overseas.\u003cbr /\u003eDifferent departments within TfL may share information to help ensure compliance with the HGV safety permit scheme and to monitor the effectiveness of the Direct Vision Standard more generally.",

     "After enforcement begins in October 2020, if you fail to pay an outstanding PCN, we may apply to the Traffic Enforcement Centre at Northampton County Court to register the money owed as a debt. This allows us to take further steps to recover it. In order to do this we will share details of your PCN and other relevant information with them. We will send you a copy of the information at the same time.",
     "If your PCN continues to be unpaid, we may pass the unpaid debt to an enforcment agent to collect the money owed on TfL's behalf.",
     "At our discretion, we may disclose personal data in response to valid requests from the police. Before we authorise any disclosure, the police have to demonstrate that the personal data concerned will assist them in the prevention or detection of a specific crime, or in the apprehension or prosecution of an offender. Each request from the police is dealt with on a strictly case-by-case basis to ensure that any such disclosure is lawful and in accordance with data protection legislation.",

     "We're actively contacting affected people and businesses (using HGVs over 12 tonnes) who have been a congestion charge, LEZ or ULEZ customer in the past 13 months and who we hold an email address for. We will provide you with information about the Direct Vision Standard, how to check your vehicle's star rating and how to apply for a Safety Permit.",
     "We will do this by checking the number plate of a HGV to see whether it will be required to have a safety permit (ie whether the vehicle is over 12 tonnes).",
     "If you're not already a road user charging customer and your HGV has been seen within Greater London by our cameras, we will also write to you with advice on what to do next in order to comply. To do this, we will pass the number plates to the DVLA, so that they can match them against their database of registered keepers - and send you advice from TfL on how to check your vehicle's DVS star rating and how to apply for a Safety Permit.\u003cbr /\u003eWe're working with the DVLA to contact people in this way as part of TfL's statutory obligations to raise awareness of the Direct Vision Standard and Safety permits and take all reasonable steps to help affected road users comply with the scheme.",
     "In order to protect your privacy as much as possible for the purposes of this mail out, TfL will not provide the DVLA with any details of when or where your vehicle was seen by our cameras - and, in turn, they will not provide TfL with your name or any of your contact information.",
     "Therefore, if you receive a letter and need to contact us about it, you must include details of your vehicle number plate as we do not have a database of names and addresses and the associated vehicle number plates.",
     "The DVLA will not use the number plates received from TfL for any other purpose and both TfL and DVLA will delete the data as soon as possible after the mail-outs are complete.",
