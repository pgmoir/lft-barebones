     "In June 2019, we introduced a new requirement that all applicants must supply a scanned image of their passport details page (the page with your photograph and passport number) as part of the online application process for a 60+ Oyster photocard. We did this in order to prevent and detect fraudulent applications, and to ensure that our concessionary travel schemes are only used by those people actually eligible to do so.

We may, for example, check that you still live in London, or whether hold another concessionary travel discount such as a Freedom Pass.",
     "To ensure you continue to receive free travel in London after your 60+ Oyster photocard expires, TfL can provide your personal details to London Councils, so that they can offer you an Older Person's Freedom Pass.

This is strictly for the purpose of assessing your appeal, and any information sharing is managed in accordance with relevant privacy and data protection legislation.",
