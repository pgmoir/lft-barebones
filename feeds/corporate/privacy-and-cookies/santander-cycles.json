     "At our discretion, we may disclose personal information in response to valid requests from the police. Before we authorise any disclosure, the police have to demonstrate that the personal information concerned will assist them in the prevention or detection of a specific crime, or in the apprehension or prosecution of an offender. Each request from the police is dealt with on a strictly case-by-case basis to ensure that any such disclosure is lawful and in accordance with data protection legislation.",
     "You, and any additional user authorised by you, are expected to adhere to the scheme's terms and conditions and code of conduct while using a hire bike. In the event that the police obtain information regarding non-compliance with these terms and conditions, any applicable laws and/or Santander Cycles code of conduct while you (or an additional user) are using a cycle, the police may provide TfL with details about this. Such information may be used by TfL to exclude or suspend you (or an additional user) from using Santander Cycles.",

Such events may include those involving public health, public safety or national security matters, when access to personal information is necessary to manage the incident.

     "We also use analytics (similar to cookies on websites) which are small files that capture anonymous data to help us improve the app's performance. We use them to collect information about your use of the app, such as what app content you access most frequently, or if you receive an error message when using the app.",
     "If you opt in, we will also send you notifications via the app, or use location services to provide you with relevant information about your use of the scheme. You can change your mind at any time by amending the settings within your device.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"GPS Trial\"}",
     "As of January 2020, TfL will be trialling the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) technology on a number of bikes in the Santander Cycles fleet. The trial will last up to 12 months and GPS enabled bikes will be deployed randomly at docking stations across the cycle hire network.",
     "At the moment we know when a bike has been successfully returned back to a docking station. What we are currently unable to tell, in cases where bikes are not properly returned, is exactly where they are. We rely on reports from customers or them being spotted by our bike distribution teams, so we can locate and retrieve them.",
     "The purpose of this trial is to establish whether GPS technology will help us find those lost and stolen bikes; it is hoped that using GPS to identify the last known location will provide us with the opportunity to retrieve abandoned or stolen bikes. This will avoid the cost of replacing them and ensure that the maximum number of cycles are available for our customers to use when they need them.",
     "Before starting this trial, we undertook a Data Protection Impact Assessment; as a result, GPS data collected within this trial will only be used for the purpose of identifying the last known location of a bike that has not been successfully returned. It will not be used to track individual users or individual journeys made, and will not be combined or matched with any other data held about Cycle Hire members or casual users. There are controls in place to ensure that the GPS data collected is kept separate from all other customer data we hold about users of Santander Cycles.",

     "We understand that there may be scenarios where the data could be useful to the police and other law enforcement bodies. As with current processes for other data held, when we get a request to disclose data, we require the police to demonstrate that the data concerned will help them to prevent or detect crime and/or prosecute offenders.",
     "Alongside information on this page, we are placing stickers on the terminals at our docking stations, as well as on the bikes themselves. We will also be notifying our App users via a push notification and you may see updates on our social media feeds or local press.",
     "At the end of the trial, we will evaluate the findings. Any remaining GPS data will be 'depersonalised' so it can no longer be attributed to an individual bike. If we decide to roll out the wider use of GPS technology across the whole cycle hire fleet, or make secondary use of the data collected, we will undertake further data protection impact assessments, inform our customers and update this privacy page further.",
