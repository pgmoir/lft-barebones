     "If you select 'use my location' when submitting a report, we will also temporarily hold your latitude and longitude so that you can be taken to the correct part of the map.",
     "When reports are made there is a 'free text' box for you to add additional information.  Occasionally people enter personal data here, but we don't recommend this. You should only enter personal data in the designated fields.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Legal basis for using your information\"}",
     "Under data protection legislation, TfL is only allowed to use personal information if we have a proper reason or 'legal basis' to do so.  In the case of reporting a problem on a TfL maintained street, there are a number of these 'legal grounds' we rely on, which are:",

     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Obtaining and using your information\"}",
     "The personal information we hold is provided by you when you report a problem on our Street Care website.  Your report is then routed to the appropriate TfL team so the issue can be investigated and resolved.",
     "Your email address will be used to verify your report (ie we will email you to confirm you want to submit your report) and to confirm successful submission.  It will also be used to provide you with an update, if you have asked for one.  All emails will contain a link for you to unsubscribe from any future communications.",
     "So we can reduce the same issue being reported multiple times, all reports of problems are available on the Street Care website for others to view.  This includes a summary of the problem and photographs (where provided).  When you make a report, you also have the option of making your name public against the report, but you do not have to do this.  No other personal details will be made public.",
     "TfL has a contract with a third party supplier, mySociety, for the provision of the Street Care website.  mySociety also runs a service called FixMyStreet.  If you report a problem in relation to a TfL-maintained street directly on FixMyStreet, rather than the Street Care website, mySociety will share your report (and personal details if provided) with us.",
     "This sharing is in accordance with the FixMyStreet terms of service and their \u003ca href=\"https://www.fixmystreet.com/about/privacy\"\u003eprivacy statement\u003c/a\u003e .  When  TfL receives this information we will hold it as explained on this page.",

     "We take the privacy of our customers very seriously. A range of robust policies, processes and physical and technical measures are in place to control and safeguard access to, and use of, personal information. This includes information associated with the reporting and investigation of problems on TfL maintained streets.",
     "Anyone with access to personal information held in TfL's systems has to complete TfL's privacy and data protection training every year.",

     "In some circumstances, disclosures of personal data to the police (and other law enforcement agencies) are permitted by data protection legislation, if they relate to the prevention or detection of crime and/or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders. Before any disclosure takes place, the police must show that the personal data concerned will help them in this respect. Each police request to TfL is dealt with on a strict case-by-case basis to make sure that any such disclosure is lawful and in accordance with data protection legislation.",
