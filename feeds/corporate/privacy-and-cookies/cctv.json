     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Camera systems we operate\"}",
     "Our CCTV is used to capture and monitor images of events that take place in specific locations in real time. The images may also be recorded on a computer hard drive or magnetic tape depending on the type of camera. Cameras may be focussed on a fixed location, set to scan a particular area, or they can be operated remotely by specially trained operators.",
     "Some TfL employees are issued with body worn CCTV cameras, for example, Revenue Control Inspectors and some station staff on the London Underground network, Bus Station Controllers in bus stations, Revenue Protection Inspectors on buses, Road Traffic Enforcement Officers and Taxi and Private Hire Compliance Officers. These devices are able to capture audio recordings as well as images. The cameras are clearly visible and are only switched on in the event of an incident (for example the member of staff being subjected to verbal abuse or threats of violence).",
     "The cameras used to enforce our Road User Charging schemes (the Congestion Charge, Low Emission Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone) are ANPR cameras which capture number plate data in the form of text rather than images. A still photographic image is also captured and used for evidential purposes if a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN) is issued.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Why we operate cameras\"}",
     "Under data protection legislation, we are only allowed to use personal information if we have a proper reason or 'legal basis' to do so. In the case of surveillance cameras, we operate them to perform tasks in support of our statutory functions - which are to deliver 'safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services to, from and within Greater London'.",
     "We operate surveillance cameras for these main purposes:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Protecting the health and safety of employees, customers and members of the public\",\"Protecting property and other infrastructure\",\"The management and investigation of major incidents\",\"Preventing and detecting crime and antisocial behaviour - including fare evasion\",\"Realtime traffic monitoring\",\"Enforcing traffic rules and regulations (eg relating to yellow box junctions, red routes and bus lanes); and our \\u003ca href=\\\"/corporate/privacy-and-cookies/road-user-charging\\\"\\u003eRoad User Charging Schemes\\u003c/a\\u003e \",\"Supporting the efficient management and operation of our road and rail networks\",\"The exercise or defence of legal claims\"]}",
     "We sometimes use stand-alone filming equipment on our road network to create a visual summary of the operational changes we make from time to time.",
     "Examples might include improvements to the layout of road junctions, or cycle lanes or where we amend traffic signal timings. We use these videos both internally and externally to demonstrate how these changes have contributed to the Mayor's Transport Strategy and other initiatives such as the \u003ca href=\"/corporate/about-tfl/how-we-work/planning-for-the-future/healthy-streets\"\u003eHealthy Streets Approach\u003c/a\u003e .",
     "Every effort is made to ensure that the focus of any photographs or videos is the road network itself and not individual pedestrians, vehicles or cyclists. In the event that we inadvertently capture images of individuals - or vehicle number plates - we will use redaction techniques to minimise the extent so that people and cars are recognisable.",
     "If you are concerned about appearing in any video, please speak to a member of the staff at the time to stop filming and delete the footage that includes your image.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Camera locations\"}",
     "We have surveillance cameras in and around the following locations:",

     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Keeping personal data secure\"}",
     "We take the privacy of our customers and the wider public very seriously and a range of robust policies, processes and technical measures are in place to control and safeguard access to, and use of, personal data associated with our surveillance camera systems.",
     "Our CCTV may be stored on servers hosted within the United Kingdom or the European Economic Area (EEA). Any such storage will be subject to contractual safeguards and carried out in accordance with the requirements of UK and EU privacy legislation.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Sharing personal data\"}",
     "TfL has contracts with a number of third party service providers, which provide maintenance services and ensure the efficient day-to-day operation of our surveillance camera systems. We also use external service providers to download images from bus stations, London Underground stations and car park CCTV cameras when we have a business need to retain them for longer than the default retention period.",
     "On a case by case basis we may use and share CCTV images for research and analysis purposes. For example these may be used to improve the management of health and safety incidents, or travel demand management.",
     "Some of TfL's surveillance camera infrastructure is shared with third parties such as the police and local authorities. In certain agreed circumstances, they may take control of a limited number of cameras and use them for activities such as the prevention and detection of crime and anti social behaviour, policing major events and crowd control. These arrangements are covered by information sharing agreements and TfL is not responsible for the camera when it is in the control of the third party.",
     "Under a separate arrangement, we also share the ANPR cameras we use to enforce our Road User Charging schemes with the Metropolitan Police Service, who receive a direct feed of data for the purpose of preventing and detecting crime and for safeguarding national security. Find out more about this on our \u003ca href=\"/corporate/privacy-and-cookies/road-user-charging\"\u003eRoad User Charging privacy page.\u003c/a\u003e ",
     "In some circumstances, other disclosures of personal data (including CCTV and body worn camera images or audio) to the police and other law enforcement agencies are permitted by data protection legislation, if they relate to the prevention or detection of crime and/or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders. Before any such disclosure takes place, the police are required to demonstrate that the personal data concerned will assist them in this respect. Each police request to TfL is dealt with on a strictly case-by-case basis to ensure that any such disclosure is lawful.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"London's buses\"}",
     "London's bus services are operated by individual bus companies on behalf of TfL. Any CCTV on London buses is the responsibility of the company that runs that particular service or route.

Some licensed taxi and private hire drivers/operators have installed CCTV (and, in some cases, audio recording) in their vehicles for the purposes of protecting the health and safety of drivers and passengers; and the prevention and detection of crime. Each individual driver/operator that has chosen to do so is fully responsible for their own CCTV system(s).",
     "TfL's Taxi and Private Hire function provides formal guidance to drivers and operators wishing to install CCTV, which outlines the standards with which the equipment must comply. Once installed, CCTV equipment is examined as part of the annual taxi or private hire vehicle licensing inspection.",
