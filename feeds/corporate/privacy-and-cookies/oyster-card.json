     "If you contact Customer Services in connection with your Oyster card, we will create a record of this. If you phone us your call may also be recorded for training and quality purposes.",
     "TfL's ticketing systems record the location, date and time an Oyster card is used to make a journey on TfL's network, affiliated National Rail services or London River on services on which Oyster cards are accepted.",
     "If you sign up for an online account or complete a registration form and provide your email address, from time to time we will send you travel related information by email. These will be messages that are useful to know in relation to the products you have bought or services that you use, and might include.",

     "We appreciate that you don't always want to be contacted in this way, so all our emails will include a hyperlink so you can opt out from receiving future service messages at any time.",
     "We will only send you messages about TfL's offers and promotions (marketing messages) if you choose to receive them, and you can change your marketing preferences at any time.",
     "There are some communications that we have to send you to fulfil our contractual obligations to you. These include emails regarding purchases or other financial transactions you've made, such as Auto top-up, pay as you go transactions or processing a refund.",
     "TfL will never pass your personal information to any other organisation for marketing purposes without your prior consent.",
     "TfL will use aggregated or depersonalised Oyster journey information to carry out research and analysis, for example, to look at travel demand, provide customers with information on how busy stations are at particular times and to make improvements to our transport services. Individuals will not be identified using this information.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Choosing not to provide personal information\"}",
     "You can use your Oyster card to pay as you go at any time without providing your personal information to TfL. You can also add weekly and monthly season tickets to your Oyster card without needing to register your card or create an online account.",
     "If you choose not to provide personal information to us, you will not be able to open an online account or get a refund if your card is lost or stolen. It may also delay or prevent us from offering other services to you such as the resolution of complaints or concerns.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Length of time we keep information\"}",
     "TfL will retain personal information in line with its data retention policies. This means that we will not hold information for longer than is necessary for the purposes we obtained it for.",
     "We retain data about the individual journeys made using your Oyster card for eight weeks after the card is used. After eight weeks, the journey data in the ticketing system is disassociated from your card (ie pseudonymised). This eight-week period is considered reasonable to enable customers to verify or make enquiries concerning their journeys (for example, for refund purposes).",
     "Some journey information is also stored on the Oyster card itself; this comprises the last eight journeys and related charges, up to three season ticket products, (generally the most recent three tickets, including future dated), and the last two incomplete journeys, if any. If you don't use your Oyster card very often, the data stored on the card may be older than eight weeks.",
     "However, no other data is stored on the Oyster card itself (eg name or address).",
     "Details of debit or credit cards used to get a card (ie pay the deposit) and add pay as you go credit and/or a season ticket are retained for a maximum of 18 months.",
     "IP addresses collected when you access your Oyster online account are retained for 13 months. This helps TfL monitor for things like online fraud, for example when people apply for online refunds.",
     "Call recordings made when you contact Customer Services are kept for 6 months.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Keeping personal information secure\"}",
     "We take the privacy of our customers very seriously, and a range of robust policies, processes and technical measures are in place to control and safeguard access to, and use of, personal information associated with Oyster data. This includes payment card data which is handled in accordance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ('PCI DSS').",
     "Anyone with access to personal information held in TfL's systems is required to complete TfL's privacy and data protection training on an annual basis.",
     "We also publish \u003ca href=\"/corporate/privacy-and-cookies/protect-your-data\"\u003eguidance\u003c/a\u003e on the steps you can also take to protect your personal information.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Automated processing and profiling\"}",
     "Under data protection legislation we have to let you know when we use your personal information to do something 'automatically' using our computers or other systems, or make an automated decision (without human intervention) that significantly affects you.",
     "If you are a pay as you go customer, TfL calculates the fares you are charged using automated means - ie using the location where you start your journey (touch in) and, if travelling by train or tube, end your journey (touch out). If you use a pink card reader, that data will be used to confirm you took a particular route and charge you accordingly.",
     "On some occasions, TfL may 'auto complete' a journey for you if you do not tap your Oyster card on a yellow reader at both ends of your journey. We do this by looking at other journeys you have made previously and making an assumption about the likely origin or destination of the incomplete journey.",
     "If you are due a refund as a result of TfL auto completing your journey (eg if you were originally charged a maximum single fare), we will also automatically load the refund amount to your Oyster card.",
     "We may also proactively issue you a refund if we can see from your journey history that you have been affected by a major disruption or incident that has severely impacted your travel.",
     "If you believe you have been incorrectly charged, or not received a refund you were due, you can ask Customer Services to review those transactions.",
     "We analyse journey patterns and transaction history to inform measures to protect TfL against fare evasion and fraudulent transactions. We use this data in different ways. For example, to identify 'hotspots' so we can deploy Revenue Inspectors in certain London Underground stations or on particular bus routes.",
     "We may also use the outcome of our analysis to contact Oyster card holders directly, with advice to touch in and out at the correct stages of a journey. In cases where we suspect fraud, we might invite you to attend a formal interview with us.",
     "We may also suspend Oyster cards based on their initial purchases, subsequent top ups and disable online Oyster and contactless accounts based on online activities.",
     "We also use your journey history, travel patterns, or frequently used stations as the basis for sending service messages. For example if you regularly use the Central Line, we might use this information to help decide that messages about service alterations on that line would be helpful for you know.",
     "Similarly, we may use postcode information to decide that it would be useful for you to know about changes to travel services near where you live, such as a station or bus stop closure or a road closure or diversions.",
     "The purpose of this type of profiling is to make sure that we send only information to people who will actually find it relevant and useful. You are able to opt out from receiving these kinds of messages at any time.",
     "Part of our statutory responsibilities includes a duty to do all we reasonably can to reduce crime and disorder on and around the transport system - and we work together with our local authority, policing, and other law enforcement partners as part of this.",
     "We may use aggregated or depersonalised Oyster journey data to undertake intelligence, analysis and research activities to identify and inform responses to a number of issues including:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Reducing all crime and anti-social behaviour on and around the public transport network\",\"Creating crime and anti social behaviour strategies\",\"Targeting crime and disruption hotspots to better coordinate and deploy policing resources\",\"Reducing fear of crime and improving public confidence in the safety of the journeys they make in the Capital\"]}",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Sharing personal information\"}",
     "TfL has contracts with a number of third party service providers, who provide the majority of the administration and 'back office' services that ensure the efficient day-to-day operation of the Oyster card scheme. This includes the ticketing systems, some customer services and the customer relationship database.",
     "If you use your Oyster card on National Rail services, we may share your personal data with the relevant train operating companies for the the same purposes as TfL handles your data - that is customer services and administration, the provision of travel related information, customer research and fraud prevention. The same applies if you use your Oyster card on river services operated by other companies.",
     "Where you have agreed to receive marketing messages from train operating companies, we will pass them your contact details.",
     "If you appeal against a penalty fare notice issued on a National Rail service and you state that you used your Oyster card for that journey, the independent appeals body may verify the information you provide against journey data held in our ticketing systems. This is strictly for the purpose of assessing your appeal, and any information sharing is managed in accordance with relevant privacy and data protection legislation.",
     "We have partnerships with a number of academic institutions in the UK and overseas (eg the USA), who work with us to analyse journey patterns and undertake travel modelling to help us understand the way our customers travel so we can improve and plan our services for the future.",
     "To do this we provide them with journey data derived from our Oyster ticketing systems that has been processed, replacing data, where required, with alternative identifiers (pseudonyms) so that it isn't possible to identify an individual customer.",
     "All academic research is carried out in accordance with privacy and data protection legislation and protected by robust confidentiality agreements.",
     "In some circumstances, disclosures of personal data to the police (and other law enforcement agencies) are permitted by data protection legislation, if they relate to the prevention or detection of crime and/or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders. Before any such disclosure takes place, the police are required to demonstrate that the personal data concerned will assist them in this respect. Each police request to TfL is dealt with on a strictly case-by-case basis to ensure that any such disclosure is lawful and in accordance with data protection legislation.",
     "TfL may also receive or disclose personal information about customers in relation to certain emergency situations or other incidents that require an immediate response. Such events may include those involving public health, public safety or national security matters, when access to personal information is necessary to manage the incident. In some situations, we may also be required by law to disclose your personal data to the police or other enforcement, regulatory or Government body, upon a valid request to do so. These requests will be assessed on a case-by-case basis and take into account privacy considerations before a disclosure is made.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Overseas processing\"}",
     "TfL, its service providers and academic research partners currently process personal information relating to Oyster within the UK, the European Economic Area and the USA. Any such processing is subject to appropriate contractual safeguards and carried out in accordance with the requirements of UK and EU privacy legislation.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Using the ticketing app\"}",
     "If you download and use our mobile ticketing app, certain information may be collected automatically. This may include the type of mobile device you are using and its unique identifier (such as the device name or ID), Internet Protocol (IP) address, Media Access Control (MAC) address, and IMEI number.",
     "We also use analytics (similar to cookies on websites) which are small files that capture data to help us improve the app's performance. We use them to collect information about your use of the app, such as what app content you access most frequently, or if you receive an error message when using the app.",
     "If you opt in, we will also send you notifications via the app. You can change your mind at any time by amending the settings within your device.",
