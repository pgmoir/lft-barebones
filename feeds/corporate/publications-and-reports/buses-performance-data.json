Included in the reasons for this are improved operating conditions arising from a reduction in roadworks, improved signal timings and a slowing of economic growth. However, events causing significant delays to buses in the quarter included industrial action on the London Underground, climate change protests over several days, a series of demonstrations by taxi drivers, a bus garage fire and various burst water mains and emergency works. Lost kilometres due to mechanical and staff reasons were both higher compared with a year ago, the latter being impacted by industrial action at a contracted bus operator.",
     "Until 2017/18, average bus speeds had been in consistent decline. The deterioration has started to reverse over the past 21 months, although speeds remain much slower than in 2014. Overall bus speeds in Q3 were close to the position a year ago as was the inner/outer London split. The Inner SW area showed a particular improvement whilst Outer SE deteriorated (but still had the highest average speed of any area).",
     "Compared with Q3 a year ago, EWT has deteriorated slightly but is still showing some of the best ever results. Inner SW London has shown a particular improvement whilst Outer SW stayed the same and all other areas deteriorated slightly. Punctuality of low frequency services was slightly worse than the same quarter a year ago, but night buses departing on time has improved",
