     "Operated mileage results were worse than Q3 a year ago, with an increase in all categories of lost mileage. Losses due to traffic delays increased slightly from a level that had been the lowest seen for twenty years, driven by a reduction in roadworks, improved signal timings and a slowing of economic growth. Events causing significant delays to buses included Extinction Rebellion protests in the autumn, various other marches and demonstration, a serious incident on London Bridge and a NATO Summit. Heavy rain and burst water mains also had an impact. Lost kilometres due to mechanical and staff reasons were also higher compared with a year ago with several bus operators experiencing problems retaining and recruiting staff.",
     "Until 2017/18, average bus speeds had been in consistent decline. The deterioration has been reversing over the past 2 years, although speeds remain much slower than in 2014. Overall bus speeds in Q3 were slightly slower than a year ago being impacted by the higher level of disruption affecting operated mileage. Speeds declined slightly in all inner London areas and there was a higher level of decline in all outer London areas.",
     "Compared with Q3 a year ago, EWT has increased slightly although in general terms is still achieving some of the best ever results. Both inner and outer London were worse than the same quarter last year but the outer SE area showed an improvement.  Punctuality of low frequency services was better than the same quarter a year ago but night buses departing on time deteriorated.",

A blend of operational and customer metrics are used to track the performance of the bus network.",
