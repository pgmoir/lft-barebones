Included in the reasons for this are improved operating conditions arising from a reduction in roadworks, improved signal timings and a slowing of economic growth. However, events causing significant delays to buses in the quarter included various protests which included multiple taxi driver demonstrations, activation of the adverse weather process for snow at the end of January and various road traffic collisions, burst water mains and emergency works. Lost kilometres due to mechanical and staff reasons were both slightly lower compared with a year ago.",
     "Until 2017/18, average bus speeds had been in consistent decline. The deterioration has started to reverse over the past 2 years, although speeds remain much slower than in 2014. Overall bus speeds in Q4 matched the position a year ago as did the inner/outer London split. The Inner NW area showed some improvement whilst Inner NE, Outer SE and Outer SW deteriorated slightly (though Outer SE still had the highest average speed of any area).",
     "Compared with Q4 a year ago, EWT has improved and in overall terms is achieving some of the best ever results. At a more detailed level the Inner NE and Inner NW have both deteriorated whilst all other areas of London have shown some improvement compared with a year ago. Punctuality of low frequency services was better than the same quarter a year ago and night buses departing on time has also improved.",
