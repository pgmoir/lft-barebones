     "People who are physically active every day reduce their risk of many illnesses, including heart disease, stroke, depression, type 2 diabetes and some cancers. By 2041, we want all Londoners to be walking or cycling for at least 20 minutes every day and for 80% of trips in London to be made by walking, cycling or using public transport.",

     "Road vehicles like cars and vans cause around half of London's air pollution. The choices people make about how they travel, such as using public transport or turning off car engines while stationary, affect the safety of the air we all breathe.
