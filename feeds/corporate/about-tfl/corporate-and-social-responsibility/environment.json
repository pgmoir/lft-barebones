     "We have set a target to achieve a 40% reduction in total NOx emissions and 50% in total PM10 emissions by 2017/18 against 2005/06 levels.",
     "The target applies to all our public transport services, including taxis and private hire vehicles. The Low Emission Zone, introduced in 2008, covers most of central London. To drive in it without paying a daily charge, vehicles must meet certain emissions standards that limit pollution coming from their exhausts. Emission standards for the zone were tightened in 2012",
     "The majority of our nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions come from buses. We have made it a priority to replace older, less efficient vehicles with some of the most environmentally friendly buses in the world.",
     "We can also influence taxi and private hire vehicle emissions through licensing arrangements (which state limits on Euro standards and vehicle age).",
     "The Mayor's Air Quality Strategy was published by the Greater London Authority in 2010. It highlighted that the vast majority of London already meets the European Union (EU) limit value for annual mean atmospheric particulates (PM10) concentrations.",
     "However, it also identified a small number of locations in central London that risk exceeding the limit.",
     "As a result, and to complement London-wide measures already being taken to improve air quality, the Mayor committed to applying targeted local measures to help the Capital meet EU targets.",
     "In March 2011, the DfT awarded us £5m to develop and deliver a package of local measures focused on reducing PM10 pollution at priority locations and other identified PM10 hotspots.",
     "This led to the creation of the Clean Air Fund programme. Achievements include:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"More than 100 buses fitted with diesel particulate filters\",\"An awareness raising and education campaign in 2012 to discourage unnecessary engine idling\",\"Deployment of five taxi marshals in central London to improve management of the ranks, discourage unnecessary engine idling and promote smarter driving courses\",\"A trial of two green walls outside Edgware Road Tube station and the Mermaid Theatre on Upper Thames Street\",\"Planting hundreds of new trees and shrubs at identified PM10 hotspots\",\"A trial application of dust suppressants at known hotspots along six road corridors (Victoria Embankment/Upper Thames Street, Marylebone Road/Euston Road, Park Lane, A2, Earls Court Road and Blackwall Tunnel approaches) and at two construction sites and five industrial waste sites\",\"Engagement with more than 300 businesses in priority locations focusing on reducing their travel and deliveries\"]}",

     "Other improvements include:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"The creation of a 15-mile segregated cycle route from west London, through the heart of the city, to Canary Wharf and Barking\",\"A new network of direct, continuous, fully-signposted 'Quietways' routes on side streets, running into the suburbs, aimed at people put off by cycling in traffic\",\"A new 'Central London Grid' of bike routes in the City and West End, using segregation, quiet streets, and two-way cycling on one-way traffic streets, to join all the other routes together\",\"More Dutch-style fully segregated lanes\",\"Bikes will also be better separated from vehicles on many streets\",\"Substantial improvements to both existing and proposed superhighways\"]}",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"Making walking count\"}",
     "Most journeys involve at least some walking, and a quarter of all journeys in London are made on foot.",
     "Encouraging people to walk more has benefits not only for their health and wellbeing, but also for the environment, economy and community.",
     "The Mayor proposes to improve the quality and provision of information and resources to make walking trips easier, and to improve the urban realm to create safer, more comfortable and attractive conditions.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Noise pollution\"}",
     "We are working to minimise transport-related noise by promoting smoother driving, the use of quieter vehicles and reducing the noise impact of roadworks and improvement projects.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Cutting down on waste\"}",
     "We monitor and aim to reduce the waste produced from our operations, construction and the public transport modes, along with increasing the proportion recycled.",
     "For example, more than 70% of newspapers, plastics, cardboard and cans left at Tube stations gets recycled.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Protecting wildlife\"}",
     "Although the Tube is often associated with underground tunnels, more than half of the transport network is above ground.",
     "The 4,000 hectares of land surrounding the Tube's rail tracks acts as a safe haven for a huge variety of wildlife, including bats, badgers, reptiles and water voles. We are working to protect and enhance the biodiversity of our track and highway verges, including street trees.",
     "We have a Green Estate management plan for our road network which comprises a Tree Strategy, Landscape Management Plan and a Biodiversity Action Plan.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"Did you know?\"}",
     "Around 550 plant species, 42 bird species, 14 mammals, 538 invertebrate species, three reptile species and three amphibian species have been recorded on our land.",
