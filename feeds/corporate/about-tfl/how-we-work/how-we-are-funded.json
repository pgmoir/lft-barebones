We must stay within the authorised limit for external debt at all times. The amount that we can afford to borrow is linked to both recurring annual income and cash available to pay financing costs.",
     "Incremental borrowing is in line with the amounts agreed with Government as set out in the March 2017 Funding Agreement Letter and will be used to fund capital investment projects, including the acquisition of new rolling stock, station and line upgrades and new cycling infrastructure.",

     "We are a public body, with no shareholders or parent companies, which means we can reinvest every pound of income in the transport network",
     "For every pound we receive, around 79% is spent on the everyday running costs of the network and around 21% on improving it for the future."
