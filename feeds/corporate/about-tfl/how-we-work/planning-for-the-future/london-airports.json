     "The Government announced in October 2016 that it would support a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/heathrow-airport-expansion\"\u003ethird runway at Heathrow Airport\u003c/a\u003e . Between February and May 2017 the Government held a public consultation on the draft National Policy Statement (NPS) that would allow for a third runway to be built.",
     "A second consultation on the NPS then followed in the autumn, incorporating significant new evidence. The Secretary of State for Transport laid the final NPS before Parliament on 5 June 2018.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Response to the Heathrow NPS\"}",
     "The Mayor has made submissions to both of the Department for Transport's (DfT's) consultations on the draft NPS. In his responses, the Mayor set out his serious concerns about the impact of a third runway at Heathrow on road and rail networks, air quality and noise.",
     "He has also responded to calls for evidence on the NPS by  the House of Commons Transport Select Committee in April 2017 and again in December 2017. A further submission was provided to clarify points raised by the DfT and Heathrow Airport Limited (HAL) during the Transport Select Committee hearings.",
     "The Mayor's NPS responses and a review of the final NPS - along with other submissions to Government and HAL consultations - are on the \u003ca href=\"/corporate/publications-and-reports/aviation\"\u003eAviation page in Publications \u0026 reports\u003c/a\u003e .",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Heathrow expansion effects\"}",
     "As part of our NPS response we did detailed analysis and modelling to understand how the expansion of Heathrow would affect road and rail access, air quality and noise.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"Road and rail access\"}",
     "An expanded Heathrow Airport would mean an additional 170,000 trips by passengers and staff each day. The Government has suggested that Heathrow can expand without resulting in any extra road trips to and from the airport. For this to happen with a third runway, the percentage of people using public transport to get there would need to increase from 39% to 65%.",
     "Our analysis indicates that this cannot happen without extra capacity on the rail networks serving the airport. The Government's proposals do not currently guarantee the significant investment needed to create this.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"Air quality\"}",
     "Heathrow is one of the worst air pollution hotspots in London and legal limits for air quality are already exceeded in the surrounding area. Even without expansion bringing more flights and more journeys to and from the airport, there is a huge challenge to clean up the air.",
     "Our analysis indicates that a bigger airport will make air pollution worse and that the Government's proposals do not show how legal limits for clean air can be met once a third runway is operating.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"Noise\"}",
     "Unacceptable noise from the airport already affects far too many people - not just those in the immediate vicinity but also those who live under the flight paths across London and in neighbouring areas.",
     "Our analysis indicates that at least 200,000 more people will be exposed to unacceptable levels of noise."
