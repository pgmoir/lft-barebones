     "A new river crossing would give thousands of people a direct, above ground link between Canada Water and Canary Wharf, and support jobs and new homes in the area.",
     "We have worked with the engineering consultants Arcadis and Knight Architects to review the need for a new crossing and explore different options to make sure the crossing chosen is value for money. We considered design and engineering issues and modelled demand for different crossings at this location, as well as speaking to local residents and stakeholders.",
     "This work led to a shortlist of three options:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Enhanced ferry service\",\"Navigable bridge that opens to allow river traffic to pass through\",\"Tunnel\"]}",
     "These options were assessed on their ability to meet the scheme's objectives, likely costs, potential benefits and possible impact.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Consultation\"}",
     "So far, a navigable bridge is our preferred option and we're investigating it in greater detail. Londoners gave their views on this decision, and other options such as a specific location, during our public consultation in late 2017/early 2018. The consultation report and our response to the issues raised are on the \u003ca href=\"https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/rivercrossings/rotherhithe-canarywharf/?cid=r2cw-crossing\"\u003eRotherhithe-Canary Wharf crossing consultation page\u003c/a\u003e .",
     "While our preference is for a navigable bridge, no final decisions have been made and Londoners are welcome to recommend alternative designs or options as part of the consultation process.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Next steps\"}",
     "We have decided to pause our work to develop a new bridge between Rotherhithe and Canary Wharf. We have identified a good solution, but an opening bridge in this place is complex and will cost more than we can afford right now.",
     "There is still a strong case for a new crossing for people who want to walk or cycle over the river between Rotherhithe and Canary Wharf. We're exploring options for a new fast ferry service to support new homes and jobs in the area. Along with our wider investment in new cycling facilities in this part of London, this would let more people to choose walking and cycling.",
     "Our work to develop proposals for a bridge means we now have a high-quality design, detailed procedures for how it would operate and plans for how it could be built in the future. We will keep this under review and update everyone once our proposals for a ferry service have moved ahead."
