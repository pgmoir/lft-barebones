     "We're looking at options instead for a new fast ferry service. Along with our wider investment in new cycling facilities in this part of London, this would let more people choose walking and cycling and support new homes and jobs in the area",
     "Our work to develop proposals for a bridge has given us a high quality design, detailed procedures for how it would operate and plans for how it could be built in the future. We will keep this under review and update everyone once our proposals for a ferry service have moved ahead.",
