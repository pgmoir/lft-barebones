     "A new river crossing would give thousands of people a direct, above ground link between Canada Water and Canary Wharf, and support jobs and new homes in the area.",
     "We have worked with the engineering consultants Arcadis and Knight Architects to review the need for a new crossing and explore different options to make sure the crossing chosen is value for money. We considered design and engineering issues and modelled demand for different crossings at this location, as well as speaking to local residents and stakeholders.",
     "This work led to a shortlist of three options:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Enhanced ferry service\",\"Navigable bridge that opens to allow river traffic to pass through\",\"Tunnel\"]}",
     "These options were assessed on their ability to meet the scheme's objectives, likely costs, potential benefits and possible impact.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Consultation\"}",
     "So far, a navigable bridge is our preferred option and we're investigating it in greater detail. Londoners gave their views on this decision, and other options such as a specific location, during our public consultation in late 2017/early 2018. The consultation report and our response to the issues raised are on the \u003ca href=\"https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/rivercrossings/rotherhithe-canarywharf/?cid=r2cw-crossing\"\u003eRotherhithe-Canary Wharf crossing consultation page\u003c/a\u003e .",
     "While our preference is for a navigable bridge, no final decisions have been made and Londoners are welcome to recommend alternative designs or options as part of the consultation process.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Next steps\"}",
     "We've been speaking with organisations such as the Port of London Authority, landowners and the borough councils on either side of the river to understand the benefits and effect of different options. Within the northern/central areas these include landing points, bridge heights, opening mechanisms and operating arrangements. Understanding these will help with the design for a navigable bridge.",
     "We are still working through these issues to make sure our proposals best reflect the needs of users of the new crossing and the river, as well as the local communities. We're now planning a public consultation in 2019."
