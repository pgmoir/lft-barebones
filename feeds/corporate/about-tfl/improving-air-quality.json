To drive in it without paying a daily charge, vehicles must meet certain emissions standards that limit pollution coming from their exhausts. Emission standards for the zone were tightened in 2012",
     "The majority of our nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions come from buses. We have made it a priority to replace older, less efficient vehicles with some of the most environmentally friendly buses in the world.",
     "We can also influence taxi and private hire vehicle emissions through licensing arrangements (which state limits on Euro standards and vehicle age).",

     "As a result, and to complement London-wide measures already being taken to improve air quality, the Mayor committed to applying targeted local measures to help the Capital meet EU targets.",
