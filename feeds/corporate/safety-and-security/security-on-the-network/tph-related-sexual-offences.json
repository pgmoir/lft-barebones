The MPS and CoLP are responsible for investigating crimes that have been committed in London. In line with Home Office crime counting rules, the figures relate to crime recorded by the police during that year, regardless of when the offence took place.",
     "Offences that are committed outside of London by London licensed drivers are investigated by the local police force for that area. These offences are not included in the figures below. TfL takes licensing action when notified of a sexual offence by a London licensed driver, regardless of which police force notifies us.",

     "These figures were correct at the time of publication and may be subject to change. Taxi and Private Hire journey-related sexual offences data is updated and published annually.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"strong\"}",

     "We recognise that operators may receive notification of a potential crime as a complaint. This may come from a passenger using their services, a driver or another member of the public. It is important that all reports of a potential crime are passed to the police immediately to ensure that the police can investigate the incidents effectively and efficiently.",

     "Some offences reported in Table 1 are unbooked and the drivers can not be traced.
