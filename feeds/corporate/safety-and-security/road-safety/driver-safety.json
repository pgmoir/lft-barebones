     "Cars were also involved in the death or serious injury of 442 people cycling and 748 motorcyclists.",
     "Human error is responsible for over 90% of all collisions on London's street. Going too fast while driving, not looking properly and making risky manoeuvers without due care or attention, are the most common causes of collisions. Over three quarters of collisions happen on or near junctions and crossings.",

     "The speed limit is not a target to aim for and can still be too fast for certain situations. For example, if it's the end of a school day, there will be more children walking or cycling so you should slow down to improve your reaction time and reduce the risk of a collision that could kill or seriously injure someone.",

They will be deployed in key areas across London at all times to increase the enforcement of road traffic offences.
