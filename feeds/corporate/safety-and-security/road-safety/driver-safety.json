     "Young drivers are especially at risk. Their lack of experience can mean they take undue risks. Almost 15% of collisions involving 17-25 year old drivers were speed related. Bus and coach drivers also present us with unique challenges.",

     "To make coach drivers more aware of the danger they can pose to cyclists, pedestrians and other road users, we run special training schemes for drivers from London's major coach companies.",

     "Exchanging Places events are aimed at bus drivers and cyclists. These are run with the assistance of the police and are similar to those organised for Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) drivers giving cyclists the opportunity to sit in the driver's seat of a HGV or bus. This allows the cyclist to see what the driver can and cannot see at the kerbside and directly in front of their vehicle. There is also the opportunity to try Exchanging Places as a virtual reality experience. These new mobile headsets allow 10 people to participate at once, and is accessible for all ages.",
