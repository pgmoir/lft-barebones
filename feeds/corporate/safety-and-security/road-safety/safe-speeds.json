     "For example, if you hit someone at 30mph they're five times more likely to die than if you hit them at 20mph. That's why this new limit is so important and why we ask for you as a driver to watch your speed as you're driving through central London.",

     "The second phase will look at a further 140 kilometres of our road network in inner and outer London, including on the inner ring road, high-risk roads and roads in town centres.",
     "We've completed a risk analysis to identify roads in inner and outer London where speeds should be lowered to reduce the risk of road users being killed and seriously injured, focusing on town centres and roads with the highest risk of a collision occurring.",

     "This might mean speeds will be lowered along some roads from 50mph to 40mph, or from 40mph to 30mph.",
     "We'll be engaging with local communities and road users about how we introduce these limits as we lower speeds across the city.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Lowering speeds with self-enforcing speed limits\"}",
     "There are many different ways to encourage people to drive at lower speeds, but evidence shows that self-enforcing speed limits are the most successful way to reduce speeds.",
     "A self-enforcing speed limit means that people are more likely to drive within the signed speed limit because they feel it's the easiest and safest speed to drive along that road. This is generally because of the way the road looks and has been designed.",
     "Some of the design and engineering measures used to lower speeds are:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Signs\",\"Road markings\",\"Speed cushions\",\"Speed bumps\",\"Raising pedestrian crossings\",\"Widening footways for people walking\",\"Giving more space to people cycling\",\"Removing the white line in the centre of a road\",\"Changing the surface of the road\",\"Creating curves along the road that requires vehicles travelling in different directions have to slow down or give way\",\"Introducing more traffic islands in the centre of the road\",\"Placing trees, planters and parklets along the roadside or in the centre of the road\"]}",
     "There's no 'one size fits all' approach to reducing vehicle speeds. We use different measures depending on the type of road, who uses the road and the road space available.",
     "We'll continue to monitor the effectiveness of these measures in lowering speeds, so we can determine if more design changes are needed.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Effect on traffic and pollution\"}",
     "Imperial University's evaluation of 20mph zones in London shows they have no net negative impact on exhaust emissions.",
     "It also shows that in 20mph zones vehicles move more smoothly, with fewer accelerations and decelerations, than in 30mph zones. This smoother driving style actually reduces particulate emissions from tyre and brake wear.",
