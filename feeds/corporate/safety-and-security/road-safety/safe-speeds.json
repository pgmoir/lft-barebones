     "A self-enforcing speed limit means that people are more likely to drive within the signed speed limit because they feel it's the easiest and safest speed to drive along that road. This is generally because of the way the road looks and has been designed.",

     "There's no 'one size fits all' approach to reducing vehicle speeds. We will need to use different measures depending on the type of road, who uses the road and the road space available.",
