     "We've installed\nspeed and red light cameras at sites where people have been killed or\nseriously injured (KSI) due to a driver going too fast or running a red\nlight. On roads where we've introduced them, the number of people killed\nor seriously injured (KSI) fell by a dramatic 50%. That means\nour cameras help prevent 500 deaths or serious injuries each year.",
     "TfL is currently undergoing a safety camera replacement programme, upgrading from wet film to digital cameras. Approximately 700 spot speed and red light cameras will be upgraded, with the programme completion scheduled for the end of 2016.",
     "Four average speed camera trial routes will be installed across London as a part of the upgrade programme. The trial routes include:",

After coming to one of these workshops,\ndrivers are much less likely to go over the speed limit.",

     "Reducing the average speed on\nLondon's roads by just one mile per hour would cut the number of\ncrashes by 6%. Speed was reported as a factor in almost half (46%) of all fatal collisions, and 39% of KSI collisions in 2015."
