     "This fund has a very different aim from most other investment-linked funds. It is designed for investors approaching retirement and considering annuity purchase. It aims to reduce the effect of changes in long term interest rates on the value of pension income the fund can purchase. Long term interest rates are one of the main factors affecting the cost of an annuity. The fund invests predominately in bonds whose prices are normally expected to rise and fall broadly in line with the cost of purchasing pension income. The fund does not provide any guarantees in relation to the level of pension income you will be able to purchase at retirement. It also does not protect against changes in the cost of purchasing an annuity that arise due to changes in life expectancy.",
     "Please note that this fund may not be suitable for everyone, for example it may not be suitable for a customer who is not considering annuity purchase or for those who intend to buy a pension that increases each year at a rate linked with inflation.",
