     "Your Basic State Pension is not affected by being contracted-out.",
     "If you were a contributing member of the Fund for any period between April 1978 and April 1997, your pension may comprise an element of GMP which attracts a different rate of increase once you reach GMP payment age, which is 60 for women and 65 for men."
