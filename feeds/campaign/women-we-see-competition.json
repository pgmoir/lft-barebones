     "The Women We See: diversity in advertising competition is aimed at creative agencies and brands. The winner will see their campaign appear across the TfL network from January 2019.  We will unveil it with a PR moment in January to make sure everyone in London knows about this great work.",

     "In 2018, the women we see in advertising are still not representative of the diversity we see around us.",
     "Existing studies show that a wide representation of men feature more in adverts - men are portrayed as sportier, they wear more clothing in adverts and are less likely to be found in the kitchen. Women, by contrast, are still largely portrayed in outdated and often negative stereotypes, with a distinct lack of diversity.",
