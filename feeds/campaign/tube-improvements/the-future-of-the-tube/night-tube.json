     "There will be an enhanced policing presence during the overnight services. The British Transport Police (BTP) will provide more than 100 officers to patrol the 144 stations that will be open throughout the night each weekend when the Night Tube services begin.

Independent research into the economic benefits of the Night Tube found that the new service will boost jobs and help maintain London's status as a vibrant and exciting place to live, work and visit.",
     "The Night Tube will cut night-time journeys by an average of 20 minutes, with some cut by more than an hour. It will also play a vital role in opening up London's night-time economy, supporting almost 2,000 permanent jobs and boosting the economy by Â£360m.",
     "Demand for a 24-hour Tube service is clear - late night Tube use has increased at double the rate of day-time trips and Night bus usage has risen by 173 per cent since 2000. There are already over half a million users of the Tube after 22:00 on Fridays and Saturdays.",
