     "They are generally used by customers  during opening hours only.",
     "Because of this, they are built to cope with lower passenger loadings  compared to a public transport escalator.",
     "Escalators and lifts on the Tube network are used by far more customers - 1.265 billion a year.",
     "They tend to be in operation in both directions for a period of up to 20 hours a day, 7 days a week, 364 days a year.",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"The machinery required to operate these escalators and lifts is therefore classed as heavy engineering machinery. It allows for reliable regular use by customers\",\"Escalator and lift replacement and refurbishment can be a lengthy process. This is due to the size and\\n    difficulty of the task:\",\"Escalators are heavy-duty machines, custom built for each station\",\"Parts have to be manufactured from scratch and installed deep underground in confined spaces\",\"The escalator parts can only be delivered in the short Engineering hours slot, because of their size. If they were to be delivered during operating hours, they would end up being in the way of customers and compromising off-loading restrictions on the size of these deliveries via road in London\",\"Old escalators have often supported other structures which need to be  carefully managed during replacement and refurbishment works\",\"A typical  heavy-duty escalator weighs 40 tonnes and has a vertical rise\\n    of 15 metres. If laid flat, it would be over 37 metres long\",\"Typically, there are six to seven (maximum 20) people working on an escalator on each shift, two shifts per day, six or seven days per week\",\"For a typical 15-metre rise escalator, there are approximately 15,000 moving parts\",\"In some stations, the escalators were installed before the Second World War and actually form part of the station structure. This was the case at Embankment, where considerable structural modernisation was required to create enough space to fit a new escalator. New, custom-built machines ensure a reliable escalator service for many decades to come\",\"All Tube escalators have full communication, fire detection and suppression systems which are required to be tested and declared operational before they can be used by the public\",\"Lift replacement work often takes place deep underground, in cramped lift shafts\"]}",
     "Due to the nature of the work it can take a number of months to complete. We're always looking at ways to reduce disruption to customers while we undertake lift and escalator refurbishment and replacement. For example, we will sometimes replace more than one lift at a time to reduce the overall time they are unavailable.",
