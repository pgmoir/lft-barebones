     "We are not looking for ideas created solely to communicate this message of ethnic diversity, though - it needs to genuinely market whatever brand or product is behind it.",
     "Our inaugural Diversity in Advertising competition in 2018 focused on challenging attitudes around gender inequality. Now we want authentic portrayals of people from our Black, Asian or minority ethnic communities, with realistic depth and resonance. The work also needs to reflect the diversity within groups as well as between them.",
     "London's rich diversity and proud tradition of openness towards people of all faiths, nationalities and backgrounds, is what truly defines us and sets us apart as the greatest city in the world. We want to see this represented in our advertising.",
     "It is not necessary to include people of more than one group in the submission to answer the brief - you could represent many groups or identities or just one Londoner. The emphasis is on being genuine and credible, and challenging stereotypes is more about authenticity and depth than simplistic representation.",
     "We welcome intersectionality, where one person can represent more than one group.",
