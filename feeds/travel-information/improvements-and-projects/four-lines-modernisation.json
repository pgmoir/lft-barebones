     "A fleet of 192 modern, air-conditioned, walk-through S-stock trains run across the Circle, Hammersmith \u0026 City, District and Metropolitan lines.",
     "These trains are longer and more spacious than the old trains they replaced. The train doors are also bigger, creating extra space for more people to get on and off at stations. This speeds up journeys.",
     "The trains also have improved audio and visual information, dedicated wheelchair spaces and colour contrasting interiors.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"New track and drainage\"}",
     "By replacing old and worn out track and points your journeys will be quieter and smoother. Coupled with brand new drainage systems, they will be more reliable during bad weather.",
     "Better drainage means that the track is much less likely to flood, reducing delays to journeys because of signal failures, as well as fewer closures for maintenance and repair works.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"New signalling system\"}",
     "Work to install a new signalling and control system began in summer 2016. This will eventually allow the trains to be driven automatically, with a train operator in the cab to open and close the doors. The train operator will be responsible for managing customer information and safety.",
     "Similar technology introduced in recent years on the Jubilee and Northern lines improved performance. The new signalling system allows trains to be run closer together, meaning a more frequent service and shorter waiting times, allowing more people to be carried. This new technology will enable us to reduce delays and improve reliability.",
     "The programme will allow us to operate 32 trains per hour, a 33% increase in peak-hour capacity. Installation work will require some line closures.",
