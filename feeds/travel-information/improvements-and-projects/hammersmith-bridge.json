The Council has asked us to consider installing a temporary walking and cycling bridge to keep this essential link across the river open.",

The bridge would be step free, with a 5.5 metre-wide surface for people walking and cycling. Access would be by shallow ramps from Queen Caroline Street on the north bank and from close to the junction of Castelnau and Riverview Gardens on the south bank.",
     "We will need planning permission from both Richmond and H\u0026F Councils to build the temporary bridge.",
