     "We appointed contractor Morgan Sindall to do the work. In 2018 they did site investigations and enabling works and produced detailed designs.",

     "Main construction work now underway is expected to finish in spring 2020.",
     "We're currently aiming to open both bridges to single lane traffic and pedestrians by the end of December 2019. This could be pushed to January 2020 at the latest if the utility companies involved can't complete their own work as part of this.",

     "The first two closures took place in February and April. The next closure will be needed in August 2019. For details, check back here or go to the \u003ca href=\"/modes/trams/planned-trams-line-closures\"\u003ePlanned trams line closures page\u003c/a\u003e .",
     "Until Friday 7 June 2019 the bridge over the tram line will be fully closed, with no access to users, including pedestrians and cyclists.",

     "The bridge is now more than 120 years old, so extensive work is needed to replace the bridge deck.",
     "When we took over responsibility for Blackhorse Lane Bridge from Network Rail in September 2013, the bridge already had a 3 tonne weight limit. Our regular surveys showed that the weight limit needed to be reduced further.",
     "Traffic weight restriction measures were put in place but the new limit was breached regularly. This is why the bridge was closed and a diversion route put in place.",
