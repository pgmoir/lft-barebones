It was widened to the south to allow the two rival companies to run their own trains on their own dedicated tracks and platforms.  A reversing track in the central passenger platform was included and the tracks were covered by a double-arch glazed roof.",

     "\u003cstrong\u003e1907\u003c/strong\u003e - The construction of the electric Piccadilly line prompted the electrification of the existing District line and a modernisation of the station.  The Metropolitan District Railway's architect, George Sherrin, designed a new entrance to the District line that included a shopping arcade, a new ticket hall space and new canopies over the platforms.",
     "The architect for the Piccadilly line, Leslie Green, provided a new ticket hall building with access to the deep-level platforms via stairs and lifts.  The building deliberately did not follow the architecture of the rest of the station but instead featured the oxblood red, glazed terracotta façade.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eLate 20th century\u003c/strong\u003e - In 1966 the reversing track separating the central platforms was decommissioned and filled in to make the wide island platform in use today.  The two outside platforms were closed and the tracks and passenger access were removed.  In 1970, escalators were installed from the ticket hall to the Piccadilly line and the lifts were decommissioned.  In 1987, the ticket hall was extended to the current configuration.",
     "The original parade of shops and residential premises along the northern\nside of Pelham Street were demolished in the early 1970s when piles\nwere sunk for a mothballed hotel development. Since then this side of\nPelham Street has been left bare with a wall and hoardings.",
     "\u003cstrong\u003eToday\u003c/strong\u003e - South Kensington station is often congested with a high demand from the local community and tourists and school groups accessing the nearby museums and cultural centres."
