     "We are still very committed to the Holborn project. Our work so far includes developing the scheme proposals and carrying out our first public consultation.",
     "Before the Government's comprehensive spending review in late 2019 we will be making the case for long-term, steady and sustained investment to ensure critical infrastructure projects such as the Holborn and \u003ca href=\"/travel-information/improvements-and-projects/camden-town-capacity-upgrade\"\u003eCamden Town\u003c/a\u003e projects can still be developed.",

     "During the evening peak, we often have to hold people outside the ticket gates, sometimes for as long as 20 minutes. Demand is set to increase and if we do nothing, these issues will become worse.",

     "These improvements would help to stimulate the local economy and generate growth in Camden Council's Holborn Growth Area. Plans for the area include a target for 2,000 new jobs and 200 new homes. The council will consult on this plan in early 2019.",
     "A possible site for a new station entrance would be at the southern end of Procter Street.",

     "This plan would reduce congestion below ground and relieve pressure on the existing Kingsway entrance. Below ground there would be more space, including a new concourse at the Piccadilly line level.",
