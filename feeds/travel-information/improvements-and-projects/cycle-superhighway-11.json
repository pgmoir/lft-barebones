     "In early 2016 we consulted on detailed proposals for the CS 11 route from Swiss Cottage to the West End.",
     "The consultation received 60% support from more than 6,000 respondents, but we needed to do more to address issues raised by the borough councils and local community. These included a concern among local residents that motor traffic would increase on some minor roads.",
     "Based on feedback we proposed to let motor traffic make right turns from College Crescent into Finchley Road, and from Finchley Road southbound into Hilgrove Road. Traffic modelling indicates this would reduce the amount of traffic into nearby minor roads, and also improve access for local people who want to reach destinations to the west of Swiss Cottage.",
     "Buses and cyclists would be allowed to turn left from Finchley Road into College Crescent. CS11 would then run along Avenue Road, the Outer Circle of The Regent's Park, Park Crescent and Portland Place."
