     "Pay as you go (paying only for the trips you make), is the easiest way to pay for travel in London. You can pay as you go on bus, Tube, tram, DLR, London Overground, TfL Rail, Emirates Air Line cable car, River Bus and most National Rail services in London. You won't have to plan the cost of your journeys in advance - we'll work it out for you.

     "London's rail network is divided into 9 zones so your fare will depend on which zones you travel in. Zone 1-9 fares are cheaper with pay as you go than buying paper single tickets. If you make a lot of journeys in one day the total cost of your daily travel will be capped (daily capping), so you'll pay less than the equivalent Day Travelcard. If you use contactless, you can also benefit from weekly capping (up to 7 days travel ending on a Sunday).",
