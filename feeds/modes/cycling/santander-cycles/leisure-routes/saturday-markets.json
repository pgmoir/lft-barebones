     "Start the day at Borough Market near London Bridge. You are in London's oldest fruit and vegetable market and this place is truly a foodie's dream. Fresh produce flows out of every corner and crevice. Energise yourself for a day of cycling by grabbing a smoothie or one of the famous sandwiches from Hobbs Pie and Mash.",
     "Once you are ready to move on, the ride continues along National Cycle Route 4 towards Waterloo Bridge. As you cross Waterloo Bridge, take in the stunning views over London. On the other end, Covent Garden awaits.",
     "There are plenty of small boutiques to browse here and you can also take a short detour to visit the \u003ca href=\"http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/\"\u003eLondon Transport Museum\u003c/a\u003e which houses the Capital's rich transport heritage.",
     "After Covent Garden there are some short busy sections as you go past Trafalgar Square but things soon become relaxed and scenic as you turn into St James Park. After pedalling past Buckingham Palace you travel under Wellington Arch and into Hyde Park. The pace here feels nice and sedate and it makes for a fantastic picnic spot if the weather permits.",
     "Finally, after a short ride down Bayswater Road, you'll reach Portobello Market. This is a large market but you have plenty of time to explore as it stays open as late as 18:30.",
     "The market has a great variety from antiques to foods and crafts. There are also often live acts playing along the street so there's plenty here to see and experience in this lively part of London.",
