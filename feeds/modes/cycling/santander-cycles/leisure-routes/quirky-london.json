     "Start this short ride by hiring a bike from Hop Exchange docking station near London Bridge. Travel a short distance down Southwark Street and turn left on Redcross Way. Here you'll find the Cross Bones Graveyard. This was a graveyard for prostitutes and paupers refused burial in church grounds on account of being judged as sinners.",
     "The otherwise unnoticeable graveyard is today marked by ribbons and other notes of sympathy that have been placed by locals. The site is said to contain the bodies of over 15,000 people.",
     "Head across the Thames and follow the cycle route straight ahead. The next sight is London's oldest church. It is the church of St Bartholomew the Great which was originally founded in 1123. It is one of the oldest surviving examples of a timber-frame house front. Near here is also the statue of the Golden Boy.",
     "The statue marks the spot where the Great Fire of London ended back in 1666. It was long believe that the fire was God's way of punishing the citizens of London for their gluttony. The golden fat boy is a reminder not to commit this sin again.",
     "The next interesting stop is the Hunterian Museum. This contains curious displays of anatomical specimens.",
     "The tour ends at Neal's Yard. The nearest docking station is on Drury Lane. Neal's Yard is a colourful little nest in the heart of London. It is home to a number of quirky shops. Near here there's also Freud's bar, serving cocktails to a small crowd underground. There's also the Monmouth coffee shop which coffee lovers will adore.",
     "Distance: 3.4 miles (5.5 km)",

     "Take the next left down London Wall, followed by the third exit at the roundabout, down Aldersgate Street. Alternatively, you can dismount and use the pedestrian crossings around the junction.",
     "Take the next left on to Long Lane, followed by a sharp left on to Cloth Street and then a sharp right on to Middle Street. Continue straight ahead and on the left you'll see the church of St Bartholomew-the-Great.",

     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"Fat Boy to Hunterian Museum\"}",
     "Pedal down Cock Lane and turn right at the end. You'll reach Smithfield Market where you'll need to take a right on the main road, up Farringdon Street. Alternatively, you can dismount and use the pedestrian crossings around the junction.",

     "At the roundabout, take the third exit down New Fetter Lane and continue straight ahead.",
     "At the end of New Fetter Lane, turn right on to Fleet Street, followed by the next right on to Chancery Lane.",
