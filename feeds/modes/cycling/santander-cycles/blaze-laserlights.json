     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"How Blaze is powered\"}",
     "As the rider pedals, both Blaze and the front and rear flashing LEDs are charged. Blaze automatically turns on in low light conditions, showing in steady state when the rider is moving and flashing when stationary.",
     "If the bike is stationary for more than two minutes Blaze will turn off to save charge. It will also switch automatically to a steady image again once the bike is in motion.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Laser projection\"}",
     "The Laserlight was designed to have the image facing upright as seen from your handlebars.",
     "A bike will still look like a bike when seen upside-down or sideways, or from any angle in between. Its simple, striking image is the most effective way to help you be seen and to keep you safe on the roads.",
     "The light is fixed to the bike and points down to the ground.",
     "The laser image is produced by a relatively low-power Class IIIR laser component, which like all lasers can be hazardous if misused. We recommend that you avoid direct eye exposure to direct or scattered radiation. If the unit is tampered with on the bike in anyway the laser will be damaged beyond use.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"History of Blaze\"}",
     "The Blaze Laserlight was invented by Emily Brooke, a  London-based designer and keen cyclist.",
     "Originally a project for her final year at the University of Brighton, the strength of the innovation won her a place on a Santander funded entrepreneurship programme in Boston. Brooke then decided to develop the project through Kickstarter, where it attracted interest from Santander and TfL."
