     "Health, economic and community benefits from cycling and walking include:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Better connections: The cycle network will link more local people with schools, workplaces, local destinations, town centres and public transport hubs\",\"Reduced congestion: Improved cycling and walking infrastructure encourages people to change how they travel and move away from vehicles. This frees up space for public transport, freight and service vehicles\",\"Increased safety: Our new routes will reduce road danger by making streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians, and cut the dominance of motor vehicles\",\"Better business: In town centres where there's more cycling and walking, research shows people want to spend more time and money on shopping and relaxing\",\"Improved health: Physical activity reduces rates of stroke and dementia, and manages the impact of depression. Research suggests that if Londoners walked or cycled for just 20 minutes each day it would prevent one in six early deaths and save the NHS £1.6bn per year\",\"Less toxic air: Fewer people in cars improves the air we breathe, cutting down on respiratory illnesses and conditions\",\"Enhanced local areas: Where we're building these routes, we're looking at ways to make local spaces safer and more enjoyable\",\"Stronger communities: Safe cycling infrastructure will encourage more of London's diverse communities to cycle and walk. Well-designed neighbourhoods and street planting can help reduce crime\"]}",
