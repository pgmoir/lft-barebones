     "The zones have been progressively launched since 2017 - we're now over halfway to completing all 12 Low Emission Bus Zones by the end of 2019. This forms a central part of the Mayor's far-reaching plans for a drastic clean-up of London's toxic air.",

     "This should enable the buses to operate in pure electric mode for a significant period of the time they are in passenger service.",
     "The trial uses inductive charging technology allowing the buses to top up their batteries without needing to be physically plugged in.",

     "The buses have a diesel engine that will be used when battery power is depleted. But we anticipate this will only be a small amount of the time, meaning emissions on these vehicles are greatly reduced.",
     "Passengers will notice that these extended range diesel electric hybrid buses offer much lower noise and vibration levels compared to conventional diesel vehicles. The buses have significantly reduced tail pipe emissions, resulting in improved air quality and cleaner air for London.",
     "Reduced fuel use will mean lower carbon emissions. The trial will help us develop plans for greater use of electric buses in central London in the future.",

     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Live information\"}",
     "Our arrivals boards at more than 2,500 bus stops let customers know when their next bus is due. And the audio-visual technology on all of our buses helps people navigate their journeys around London.",
     "We're also making accurate, live service information available to customers on their mobile phones, tablets and other devices, as well as at roadside signs and public locations like hospital waiting rooms, schools and shopping centres.",
     "Passengers can even check when their next bus is due before leaving the house. At the same time, app developers are using our travel information to launch more and more useful products.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h4\",\"value\":\"iBus\"}",
     "We rely on a system called iBus for this information. Operating on all London Buses, iBus uses a combination of technologies, including satellite tracking, to pinpoint the location of buses, relaying information between the driver, garage and central control point.",

This will be supported by increased enforcement and further encouraging bus drivers to report infringements\",\"Reducing dwell times and enhancing bus stop accessibility to make it easier for buses to access bus stops from the carriageway and ensure passengers can board and alight safely\",\"Upgrading signals to prioritise buses at traffic signals including bus only movements\"]}",
