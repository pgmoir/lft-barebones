The buses operating in the area are made up of zero emission (at tail pipe) buses, new Euro VI standard buses, buses retrofitted to Euro VI standards and hybrid Euro VI standard buses.",

They will be a mix of hydrogen buses and electric buses. These buses will contribute to improving air quality and are also much quieter, with lower vibration levels for a more comfortable experience",

This forms a central part of the Mayor's far-reaching plans for a drastic clean-up of London's toxic air. As part of the bus retrofit programme the entire bus fleet will meet Euro VI emission standards, making the whole of London a Low Emission Bus Zone.",
