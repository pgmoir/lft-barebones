     "Vehicles more than 2 metres (6'6\") high, 2 metres (6'6\") wide or goods vehicles weighing more than 2 tonnes (gross vehicle weight) are not safe to travel through the Rotherhithe Tunnel. Drivers that do not comply could be fined up to £130.",
     "From 2 December 2019, fines will no longer be limited to one per day. Drivers of prohibited vehicles could receive a fine for every journey they make through the tunnel.",
     "This is to keep the tunnel safe. The penalty has been in place since February 2019, and we've used our discretion to limit fines issued to prohibited vehicles to one per day. However, we've seen prohibited vehicles continue to make repeat offences.",
     "The Rotherhithe Tunnel was built in 1908 and was not designed to cope with modern levels of traffic. These restrictions help to ensure that road users can continue to use the tunnel safely while we work on plans for the tunnel's future.",

     "Drivers of vehicles that do not meet these restrictions should use Tower Bridge or the Blackwall Tunnel, both of which are outside the \u003ca href=\"/modes/driving/congestion-charge\"\u003eCongestion Charging zone\u003c/a\u003e and the \u003ca href=\"/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone\"\u003eUltra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ)\u003c/a\u003e .",
     "When Tower Bridge is closed for overnight maintenance, Southwark Bridge can be used. Currently, the Congestion Charge does not apply during the hours that Tower Bridge is closed overnight. The ULEZ operates from midnight to midnight, 7 days a week, every day of the year, including weekends and public holidays.",
