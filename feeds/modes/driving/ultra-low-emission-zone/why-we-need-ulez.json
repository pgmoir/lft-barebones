     "These positive effects will be especially beneficial to the young, older people and those who have respiratory problems, as well as residents of high pollution areas.",
     "The majority of traffic entering the ULEZ will be from outside the zone, so the benefits of cleaner, greener vehicles in the form of reduced emissions will be experienced across London, even to areas not in the zone."
