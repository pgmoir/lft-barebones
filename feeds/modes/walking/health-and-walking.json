     "In London, at least 42% of adults are failing to meet the minimum levels of physical activity needed each week to stay healthy. The good news is that just 2, 10-minute walks a day can change that and improve your health and wellbeing: you'll sleep better, feel more relaxed, and significantly reduce the risk of developing a range of health problems, including Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, some cancers, depression and Alzheimer's disease.",
     "Using public transport is a great way to build some walking into your day and people who regularly use public transport are more likely to get the activity they need to stay healthy.",
