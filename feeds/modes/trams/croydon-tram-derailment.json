     "The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) published the report on its investigation into the incident in December 2017 with a further addendum published in October 2018. We welcome these reports and have continued to work alongside the RAIB, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) and First Group, who operate the tram network, to ensure all of the recommendations outlined are met. We have made significant progress on the recommendations set out by the RAIB and have completed some of the most vital. We have also published our own investigative report.",
     "Since the incident we have introduced a wide range of additional safety measures to make sure such a tragedy can never happen again. These include new signage and warning systems for drivers, additional speed restrictions, enhanced speed monitoring and an upgrade of the CCTV recording system.",
     "An in-cab driver protection device is now fitted to every tram, meaning that any sign of driver distraction or fatigue results in the driver being alerted immediately.  This is the first time such a device has been used in the rail industry in the UK and has been commended by the ORR. This system has been shared and demonstrated to the UK Tram industry for possible implementation on other tram networks.",
     "A contract was awarded in December 2018 for the installation of a system to automatically reduce tram speeds at risk locations on the network should a clear overspeed violation occur. The system will be fully installed by December 2019.",
     "We have enhanced the customer complaints process so that all reports are now managed by one dedicated TfL team and any that relate to safety are prioritised for immediate investigation. Improvements have also been made to our website to make it easier to report a safety related incident.  The TfL Sarah Hope line remains available to all those affected and continues to provide help with counselling and other support to anyone who needs it.",
     "We also continue to work with the wider tram industry to ensure that lessons are learned from this incident and that we introduce any further measures that could improve the safety of trams across the UK.",
     "Since the incident, we have been working continually to introduce additional safety measures to the tram network, including the following:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Additional speed restrictions and associated signage installed near Sandilands and at 3 other locations on the tram network\",\"A permanent speed reduction implemented across the London tram network, meaning the maximum speed trams can travel is now 70kph (previously 80kph)\",\"The installation of enhanced chevron signs at the 4 sites with significant bends to provide an additional visual cue for drivers. The number of speed signs has been increased and additional lineside digital signage will provide added speed warnings to drivers\",\"An in-cab driver protection device is now fitted to all trams to protect against fatigue and distraction\",\"The CCTV recording system on all trams of the type involved in the derailment has been replaced and upgraded to digital\",\"Working with safety experts, a new higher specification film that is 75 per cent thicker has been installed to improve the containment provided by tram windows and doors\",\"A new emergency lighting system that will operate independently of the tram's battery in the event of an emergency has been procured and will be installed in 2019\",\"A new system called iTram, derived from proven technology on buses, which will provide drivers with an in-cab speed alert is currently being tested and will be fitted to all trams by December 2019\",\"Reviewing procedures for the emergency evacuation from trams so that the speed of evacuation is improved\",\"An independent review has been jointly commissioned by TfL and First Group and our route risk assessments and risk model have now been reviewed and updated.  We have also shared these with the UK tram industry\"]}",
