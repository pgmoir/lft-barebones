     "{\"template\":\"intro\",\"texts\":[\"Earlier in 2018, we changed our tram service patterns and timetables to make our service more reliable and less crowded, with more even intervals between trams.\"],\"link\":{\"image\":{}},\"image\":{},\"wrapped\":false}",

     "The changes include:",
     "{\"template\":\"bulletlist\",\"items\":[\"Trams now depart from Wimbledon towards Arena every 5 minutes Monday to Saturday daytimes, with even gaps between trams to make waiting times more predictable\",\"At Arena, each alternate tram branches off to either Beckenham Junction or Elmers End, providing each branch with a regular 10-minute service\",\"The New Addington service runs to West Croydon, rather than Wimbledon, every 7-8 minutes (the same frequency as now)\",\"Most Elmers End services now operate through to Wimbledon rather than West Croydon, except in the evenings and Sundays\",\"Early morning trams in some areas, including the New Addington and Wimbledon branches, are more frequent to carry more people\"]}",
     "Overall, the changes will reduce typical wait times for more than three quarters of customers. Waiting times will be more predictable, with less uncertainty caused by irregular intervals between trams.",
     "The service will be more reliable. There will be fewer delays, and the network will return to good service more quickly after a delay. Trams and tram stops will be less crowded.",
     "The new service does not have line numbers. By removing them, we have been able to make destination names on the front of trams bigger, making them easier to read from a distance.",
     "{\"template\":\"htag\",\"level\":\"h3\",\"value\":\"Why we are doing this\"}",
     "Before we made the changes, there could be a long wait for a tram followed by several at once, causing some trams to be very crowded. It also could take a long time to restore full service after a delay. Without action, these problems would get worse as the network gets busier.",
     "We have a long-term plan to improve the tram network and provide more capacity. Adjusting the timetable is the first step. In future we hope to run more frequent trams on some routes, and we will continue to look at possible extensions.",
     "Before making the changes, we carried out a large scale engagement exercise with tram users and others who were likely to be affected.",
     "The new timetable will be kept under review to make sure that customers are getting the benefits we expect. We will look at what future changes may be needed as south London continues to develop.",
